> A potential learning system that emphasizes practical application while balancing theory 
### **Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)**
**Goal:** Solidify understanding of key concepts while introducing hands-on practice.

- **Day 1–3: Quick Theory Overview**
  - Review the core principles and concepts of your subject.
  - Spend about 2 hours a day going through key resources (e.g., books, lectures, articles).
  
- **Day 4–7: Initial Practice (40% Theory, 60% Practice)**
  - Each day, dedicate 2 hours to solving beginner-level problems. 
  - Review theory only when you encounter roadblocks in problem-solving.
  - Keep notes on gaps in your understanding.
  
- **Day 8–14: Deep Dive into Practice (20% Theory, 80% Practice)**
  - Focus on applying what you’ve learned to real problems.
  - Try 2–3 practice problems each day.
  - Spend a maximum of 30 minutes reviewing theory if needed to solve issues.

---

### **Phase 2: Intermediate Application (4 weeks)**
**Goal:** Shift focus to project-based learning and solving more complex problems.

- **Week 1 (Days 15–21): Targeted Problem-Solving**
  - Continue working on practice problems, but increase their difficulty.
  - Spend about 90% of the time solving problems, and 10% reviewing concepts.
  - Each day, try to solve at least one medium-level problem.

- **Week 2 (Days 22–28): Mini-Projects**
  - Start a small project that integrates the concepts you’ve learned.
  - Spend 2 hours a day building, debugging, and improving the project.
  - Only revisit theory when you get stuck, and document solutions.

- **Week 3 (Days 29–35): Expand the Project**
  - Add new features or functionalities that require deeper application of theory.
  - Focus on problem-solving, writing clean code, and creating reusable components.
  - Continue working for 2 hours a day, and spend 20 minutes each day on reviewing relevant theory.

- **Week 4 (Days 36–42): Wrap-Up and Reflection**
  - Finalize the project.
  - Review the toughest parts and how you overcame them.
  - Write a short summary of key takeaways.
  - End the week with a review of remaining weak spots.

### **Phase 3: Advanced Application and Skill Mastery (8–12 weeks)**
**Goal:** Master complex problems and larger projects by diving into advanced practice.

- **Week 5–6: Focused Mastery (10% Theory, 90% Practice)**
  - Begin solving advanced-level problems, aiming for at least 2 each day.
  - Start planning for a more complex project or product that challenges your understanding.
  - Limit theory to the specific concepts needed for problems you encounter.

- **Week 7–10: Large-Scale Project**
  - Work on a large project that integrates all the concepts you’ve learned.
  - Each day, spend about 2–3 hours on the project, focusing on problem-solving and implementation.
  - Revisit theory only when absolutely necessary.

- **Week 11–12: Final Review and Practical Refinement**
  - Reflect on the skills you’ve developed.
  - Fine-tune any weak areas by solving a range of problem types.
  - Continue working on projects, focusing on polishing the final product.

---

### **Ongoing Practice and Continuous Improvement (Post-12 weeks)**
- **Goal:** Maintain skill sharpness with a consistent balance of project work and problem-solving.
  - Dedicate 1–2 hours daily to working on more projects.
  - Solve 2–3 new problems each week to keep honing practical skills.

---

- **Weeks 1–2:** Balance theory with practice (40/60, then 20/80).
- **Weeks 3–6:** Shift to more practice-based learning (10/90), work on real projects.
- **Weeks 7–12:** Apply skills to large-scale projects, deepen problem-solving.
- **Post-12 weeks:** Maintain a routine of practice and continuous learning.
