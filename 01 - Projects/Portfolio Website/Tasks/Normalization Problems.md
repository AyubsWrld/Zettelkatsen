I have X and Y coordinates of user press and I've normalized them between $[ 0 , 1 ]$. Problem being now the Density per inch ( DPI ) causes the click on one screen to not be registered as a click on another screen. This of course becomes problematic as there is not a 1:1 correspondence between clicks on Screen A vs clicks on Screen B. However we can get over this through potentially scaling by the DPI.
