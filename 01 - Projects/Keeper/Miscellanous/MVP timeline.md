To help you prioritize the final steps for your MVP, it sounds like you’re in a good place with the socket programming, dashboard UI, and database setup. To maximize functionality for your MVP, you should focus on implementing core features that will let the Guardian manage app locks, communicate with the User device, and ensure secure and reliable access control.

Here’s a day-by-day plan for the next five days to complete the MVP:

### Day 1: User-Guardian Connection and Lock Management
- **Goal**: Implement the connection functionality for the Guardian and User, including ensuring that both can connect to the server and interact via socket communication.
- **Tasks**:
  - Finalize server handling to accept and manage connections from multiple users (one Guardian, one User per session).
  - Implement code to allow the Guardian to send lock/unlock commands for specific apps to the User’s device.
  - Test socket reliability with simulated Guardian-User interactions to confirm that commands are received in real-time.

### Day 2: App Lock and Unlock Logic on the User Side
- **Goal**: Enable lock and unlock functionality on the User's device based on commands received from the Guardian.
- **Tasks**:
  - Write code that listens for the Guardian’s lock/unlock commands and applies them to the designated apps on the User’s device.
  - Integrate the database to log these commands, which will help keep track of locked/unlocked states and give the Guardian a view of current restrictions.
  - Test app locking/unlocking functionality to ensure it’s responsive and only allows approved apps to be accessed.

### Day 3: Guardian Dashboard Functionality
- **Goal**: Enhance the Guardian's dashboard to allow app management and provide status updates from the User’s device.
- **Tasks**:
  - Build out UI controls in the dashboard for selecting apps to lock or unlock and display the current status of each app.
  - Set up real-time status indicators that show whether the lock is active, app access status, and connection stability between Guardian and User.
  - Integrate feedback mechanisms (e.g., notifications or status text) that inform the Guardian of successful or failed lock/unlock commands.

### Day 4: Testing and Security Enhancements
- **Goal**: Test end-to-end functionality and add basic security features to protect the communication and restrict unauthorized access.
- **Tasks**:
  - Test the app in multiple scenarios (intermittent connection, both devices online/offline) to ensure smooth operation and identify potential bugs.
  - Implement basic security measures such as device pairing codes or session IDs to ensure the Guardian is connected only to the intended User’s device.
  - Add error handling in case of dropped connections or other interruptions, providing both parties with relevant notifications or re-connection prompts.

### Day 5: Final Tweaks and Documentation
- **Goal**: Polish the MVP with any last UI adjustments, ensure all functionality is smooth, and prepare documentation.
- **Tasks**:
  - Fine-tune the UI, including error messages, notification systems, and the overall look of the Guardian’s dashboard.
  - Document the MVP’s features, usage instructions, and any known limitations or issues.
  - Perform a final run-through of all features (connections, locks, dashboard controls) to verify everything works as expected.

Following this plan will ensure that your MVP includes the key functionalities and is as reliable as possible. Good luck with *Keeper*!
