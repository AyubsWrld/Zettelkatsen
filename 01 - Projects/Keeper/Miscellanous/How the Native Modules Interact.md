#####  [[implementation.swift]]
____
- This is the implementation file wherein the implementation of the native modules occurs . within this file all the logic for the native module is written . 
- It holds the actual native functionality that you want to expose to the React Native side. This is where the core logic resides.

##### [[objc.m]]
____
- This is an `Objective-C` file which contains the files which are capable of being called by `React-native`  .  The Bridge system allows the JavaScript code to call the code , and this file tells `React-native` how to call the swift code from JavaScript .  
- In short this file declares the methods that are available for use in React Native. It translates the JavaScript calls into something that the Swift code understands.
##### [[01 - Projects/Keeper/Native APIs/ios/Counter.m/RCTBridgeModule.h]]
____
- This is the header file which allows `Swift` code to be used within an `Objective-C` environment . Since `React-native`s bridge is written in `Objective-C` , This header file is needed to include Swift code in the bridging process . 
- It tells the Objective-C runtime about the Swift classes and methods that can be used. This file is essential for integrating Swift with Objective-C in projects that involve React Native.

### Refined Analogy:

Imagine you and your friends decide to visit a fancy Russian bakery that’s famous for its exquisite, pre-made pastries. Here’s how the experience unfolds:

1. **The Menu ([[objc.m]]):**
    
    - **What it represents:** The menu at the bakery.
    - **Role:** The menu lists all the pastries that are available for you to order. However, you can only order what's on the menu—no special requests. In our analogy, this menu is like the `Counter.m` file, which defines the exact set of methods (or pastries) that you can order from the JavaScript side in React Native.
2. **The Cashier ([[01 - Projects/Keeper/Native APIs/ios/Counter.m/RCTBridgeModule.h]]):**
    
    - **What it represents:** The friendly cashier who takes your order.
    - **Role:** The cashier is bilingual; they understand both English and Russian. When you place your order in English, the cashier takes it and translates it into Russian, which the chef understands. This is analogous to the `NativeAPI-Bridging-Header.h` file, which enables the Objective-C (menu) to communicate with the Swift code (chef). Without the cashier's translation, the chef wouldn't know what to prepare.
3. **The Pre-made Pastries ([[implementation.swift]]):**
    
    - **What it represents:** The pastries that have already been prepared in the kitchen.
    - **Role:** These pastries are like the `Counter.swift` code—they’re the actual products, already made, waiting to be served. The chef (Swift code) doesn’t create new pastries on the spot but simply retrieves and delivers the ones that are already made when the order is understood. The chef follows the exact recipes (pre-written code) and can only provide what’s been prepared.
4. **The Order Process:**
    
    - **What it represents:** You place an order for a pastry from the menu (JavaScript calls a method in React Native).
    - **Role:** You tell the cashier (bridging header) what you want in English (JavaScript), the cashier translates your request into Russian (Objective-C to Swift bridging), and the chef (Swift code) retrieves the appropriate pre-made pastry (executes the logic). The pastry is then handed back to you via the cashier (results passed back to JavaScript).


This code appears to be a combination of Swift and Objective-C, used to create a native module for React Native. Let me break it down for you:

1. Swift code (Counter.swift):



```swift
import Foundation

@objc(Counter)
class Counter: NSObject {
    private var count = 0
    
    @objc
    func increment(_ callback: RCTResponseSenderBlock) {
        count += 1
        print(count)
        callback([count])
    }
    
    @objc
    static func requiresMainQueueSetup() -> Bool {
        return true
    }
    
    @objc
    func constantsToExport() -> [String: Any]! {
        return ["initialCount": count]
    }
    
    @objc
    func decrement(_ resolve: RCTPromiseResolveBlock, reject: RCTPromiseRejectBlock) {
        if (count == 0) {
            let error = NSError(domain: "", code: 200, userInfo: nil)
            reject("ERROR_COUNT", "Count cannot be negative", error)
        } else {
            count -= 1
            resolve(count)
        }
    }
}
```

This Swift code defines a `Counter` class that:
- Has a private `count` variable
- Provides an `increment` method that uses a callback
- Implements `requiresMainQueueSetup` to indicate it needs to run on the main queue
- Exports constants (initial count)
- Provides a `decrement` method that returns a promise

2. Objective-C code (Counter.m):

```objc
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import "React/RCTBridgeModule.h"

@interface RCT_EXTERN_MODULE(Counter,NSObject)
RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(increment:(RCTResponseSenderBlock))
RCT_EXTERN_METHOD(decrement:(RCTPromiseResolveBlock)resolve reject:(RCTPromiseRejectBlock)reject)
@end
```

This Objective-C code:
- Declares the `Counter` module for React Native
- Exposes the `increment` and `decrement` methods to JavaScript

3. Bridge header:

```objc
#import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>
```

This is likely part of a bridging header file, which is necessary to expose Objective-C code to Swift.

How they fit together:

1. The Swift file (`Counter.swift`) contains the main implementation of the `Counter` module.
2. The Objective-C file (`Counter.m`) acts as a bridge between the Swift code and React Native's JavaScript side. It declares the module and its methods so that React Native can recognize and use them.
3. The bridging header allows the Swift code to use React Native's Objective-C interfaces.

This setup allows you to write most of your native module code in Swift while still interfacing with React Native, which primarily expects Objective-C for iOS native modules. The `@objc` attributes in the Swift code and the `RCT_EXTERN_*` macros in the Objective-C code work together to make the Swift methods accessible to JavaScript through React Native's bridge.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this setup?
