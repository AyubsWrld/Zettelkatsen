Stub generated by client. For example, client makes a call to our server with `getUserID(8)` and it gets translated to something which conforms to the [[Interface Description Language]] standard. 

For that `getUserID` call for instance, the name of the function can resolve to some 16bit hash code within a hash table that that represents the function. With this the server knows what function to call and how to interpret the payload.
