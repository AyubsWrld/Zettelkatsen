Here are some additional features you can consider adding to your app **Keepur**:

1. **Time-based Restrictions**: Allow the Guardian to set specific time windows when certain apps can be accessed, such as allowing social media apps only after 5 PM or during weekends.
    
2. **App Usage Limits**: Enable the Guardian to set time limits for specific apps. For example, the User could only use a game for 30 minutes per day, and once the limit is reached, the app would automatically lock.
    
3. **Password Protection**: Include a feature where the Guardian can set a password or PIN to change the restrictions, ensuring the User cannot bypass the settings without the Guardian's consent.
    
4. **Emergency Access**: Allow the User to request emergency access to specific apps (like phone or messaging apps) for a short time period, which the Guardian can approve or deny.
    
5. **Usage Report**: Provide detailed reports or analytics to the Guardian on app usage, including the time spent on each app, frequency of use, and any attempts to access locked apps.
    
6. **Profile Switching**: If there are multiple Users on the device, allow the Guardian to create different profiles with customized restrictions for each User.
    
7. **App Category-Based Restrictions**: Allow the Guardian to lock entire categories of apps (e.g., social media, games, entertainment) rather than selecting individual apps. This can save time when setting restrictions.
    
8. **Whitelisted Websites**: Along with app restrictions, allow the Guardian to set a list of whitelisted websites that can be accessed on the User's browser.
    
9. **Screen Lock and Focus Mode**: Create a "Focus Mode" where only selected apps are accessible, and the rest of the screen is locked or dimmed to help the User focus on specific tasks (e.g., studying).
    
10. **Notifications for Attempts to Access Locked Apps**: Send notifications to the Guardian when the User tries to access a locked app, providing real-time updates on the User's activities.
    
11. **Offline Mode**: Allow the Guardian to set restrictions even when the device is offline, ensuring that restrictions are enforced no matter the connection status.
    
12. **Parental Control Support**: Include a section where parents can view recommendations for suitable apps based on the Userâ€™s age, ensuring the User is only exposed to age-appropriate content.
    
13. **Voice Assistant Control**: Enable the Guardian to set and modify restrictions using voice commands via a voice assistant like Siri or Google Assistant.
    
14. **Customizable Lock Screen**: Add a feature where the lock screen displays a message from the Guardian, such as "Focus on studying!" or a motivational quote.
    
15. **Automatic Unlock After Task Completion**: Allow the Guardian to set tasks (like homework or chores), and the app could automatically unlock certain apps once the tasks are marked as completed.
