The app allows a **"Guardian"** (the person setting the restrictions) to lock specific apps on a mobile device. The Guardian can choose which apps to keep accessible and lock all other apps. For example, the Guardian might decide to keep educational apps and essential communication apps available, while restricting access to games or social media apps. This way, the **"User"** (the person whose phone is being managed) can only access the apps that the Guardian has approved, and all other apps are locked.

### Terminology

- **Guardian**: The individual who sets the restrictions and decides which apps are accessible or locked.
- **User**: The individual whose phone is being managed with these restrictions.
