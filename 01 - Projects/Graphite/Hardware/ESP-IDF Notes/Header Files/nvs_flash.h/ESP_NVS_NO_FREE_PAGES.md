occurs when the Non-Volatile Storage (NVS) partition on the ESP32's flash memory is full, and there are no available pages left to store data. This can happen if the NVS partition has been previously used and is now out of space.
### **Why It Happens**

1. **Old Data:** The NVS partition contains old data or remains from a previous application.
2. **Partition Size:** The NVS partition defined in the partition table may be too small for current usage.
3. **Flash Corruption:** Flash memory may have been corrupted, leading to unusable pages.
