A debug build is a version of a software program that is specifically compiled with additional debugging information and features to aid developers in identifying and fixing bugs.


**Use Case:** Debug builds are used during the development process, especially when testing and debugging code. Once the software is ready for release, a release build is created, which is optimized for performance and typically does not include debugging information.

Imagine for example whenever you create a program which has a bunch of **printf()** statements which aid in the debugging process. this is an example of a Debug build . Eventually when you wish to roll out all the changes and the finalized version of the application you would ideally want to release a version without all the **printf()** statements  .
