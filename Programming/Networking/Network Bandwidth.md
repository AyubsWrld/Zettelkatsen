Measures the maximum amount of data which can be transmitted over a network connection over some amount of time it is usually measured in *bits per second* (bps) . 

The relationship between Network Bandwidth and [[Latency]] is somewhat like Caloric Intake . In a certain amount of time , you can eat $x$ amount of food , however , the amount of time it takes for that food to be converted into nutrients is reliant on how long it takes for you to metabolize that food . The faster you can metabolize that food and utilize it as an energy source , the better .
