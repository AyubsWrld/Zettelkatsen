The `.get` method in Express is used to define a route handler for GET requests to a specified endpoint. It determines how the server should respond when a client makes a GET request to that URL.

Example:
```javascript
app.get('/example', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});
```

In this example, when a GET request is made to `/example`, the server responds with "Hello, World!".
