**Express.js** is a popular, fast, and minimal web application framework for Node.js. It is designed to simplify the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features and tools. Here's a breakdown of what Express.js is and why it's commonly used:

### 1. **What is Express.js?**

- **Framework for Node.js**: Express.js is built on top of [[Node.js]] , a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. Express.js provides a higher-level structure and tools for developing web applications and APIs, making it easier to handle common web development tasks.
- **Middleware-Based**: Express.js uses a middleware-based architecture. Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. This allows you to build a pipeline of processing steps for each incoming request.
- **Routing**: Express.js simplifies routing, which is the process of defining how your application responds to different HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) at different endpoints (URLs). You can easily define routes and attach middleware or controller functions to them.
- **Minimal and Flexible**: Express.js is unopinionated, meaning it doesn’t enforce a specific project structure or impose strict rules, allowing developers to structure their applications as they see fit.
