A Mesh is a basic scene object in threejs, and it's used to hold the geometry and the material needed to represent a shape in 3D space.

Syntactically we put any meshes we wish to render within the *mesh* tag 

```jsx
<Canvas>
  <mesh>
    <boxGeometry />
    <meshStandardMaterial />
  </mesh>
</Canvas>
```
