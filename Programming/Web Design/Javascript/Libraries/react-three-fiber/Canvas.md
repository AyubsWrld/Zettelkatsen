Canvas creates [[Scene]] and [[Camera]] which are the basic building blocks for creating our render . 

Canvas is responsive to fit the parent node, so you can control how big it is by changing the parents width and height .  

However this is not enough for us to see anything as its just allowing us to view into blank space . So we must add a [[Mesh]] .
