Logical equivalent to a `typedef` within `C` and `C++` . It is utilized to create a name for an existing type which allows for later instantiation utilizing that `typealias` . 
#### Syntax
```swift
typealias <typename> = <type> ; 
```

#### Usage
```swift
typealias ulong = UInt64 ;  // ulong defined by designer and is used to refer to a UInt64 
var a : ulong = 8 ;  // ulong set to 8 ; 
```
