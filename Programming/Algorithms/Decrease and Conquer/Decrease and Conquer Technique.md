Decrease and conquer is an algorithmic technique that involves reducing a problem to a smaller instance of the same problem, solving the smaller problem, and then extending the solution to the original problem. It typically reduces the problem size by one unit at a time, or a constant fraction, before solving it recursively or iteratively.
