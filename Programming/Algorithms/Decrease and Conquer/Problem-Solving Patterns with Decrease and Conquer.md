#### **6.1 Backtracking**

- Solves problems by trying partial solutions and then abandoning them if they are not suitable. Decrease and conquer is often applied to reduce the size of the search space.

#### **6.2 Dynamic Programming**

- Unlike decrease and conquer, which solves smaller instances in isolation, dynamic programming solves subproblems and reuses their results to avoid redundant calculations.
