Unordered collection of objects , that is $\{ 1, 2 , 3 \}$ is equivalent to $\{ 2, 1 , 3 \}$ . Sets can be defined utilizing by explicitly defining its members or through defining a rule which identifies its members . 

##### Set operations 
___
Membership , complement , Union , Intersection , Cardinality . 



##### Bit Vector Representation 
____
Given a universe and another set , we can utilize bits to represent whether each element in the set is present within the universe 

Suppose ... 

$U = \{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 \}$
$S = \{ 1 , 5 , 3 , 4 \}$
*Bit Vector $S : 1011$

When we concern ourselves with the union or intersection of two sets then referring to the universe we can take the *OR* or *AND* respectively . 

Complement we simply flip the bits
