The **greedy method** is an approach to solving problems by making the best choice at each step, without worrying about whether those choices will lead to the overall best solution. It works well when the problem has an _optimal substructure_, meaning the solution to the whole problem can be built by combining the solutions to its smaller parts.


> [!example] **Feynman Definition**
 > Imagine you are playing league of legends . Your playing against an AP champion . And while laning enemy botlane  gets a double kill and tower first blood . Knowing this you decide to build items which will help you in your fight later on against the botlane even though it might not be optimal vs the AP champion your laning against at the time , it is what works best right now . And as the game goes on your shift your build when necessary based on the games condition or what is most ideal . These decisions are irreversible and cannot be changed later in the game .
