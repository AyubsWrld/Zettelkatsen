The notion of arriving at the best solution overall through finding the best solution between the parts . We also must concern ourselves with the granularity of the subproblems and derive an equation relating a solution to any instance with solutions to its smaller sub instances . 

> *“An optimal solution to any instance of an optimization problem is composed of optimal solutions to its sub instances”*
