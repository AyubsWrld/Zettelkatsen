A set of vector objects $V$ = $(a , b , c , d)$   is called a vector space if it is closed with respect to linear operations of addition of vectors and multiplication of vectors by scalars . 

Given $a \in V$ , $b \in V$ , implies $a + b \in V$ . Given by [[Closure]] . 

#### Vector Space Laws
____
1) $a + b = b + a$ ( commutative law) 
2) $(a + b)+c = (b + c)+ a$ (associative prop) 
3) $a + b = b + a$ (Existence of [[Zero Vector]]) 
4) (Existence of the opposite) 
5) (Scaling Property) 
6) $(a + b)c = (b + c)a$ (associative prop) 
7) $(a + b)c = cb + ca$ (Distributive Laws) 
8) $(a + b)c = cb + ca$ (Distributive Laws)
