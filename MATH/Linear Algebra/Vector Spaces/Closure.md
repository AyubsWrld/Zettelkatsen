A Set $S$ is closed with respect to a binary operation  if for any object $a , b \dots , n \in S$  if $a  \times b \in S$  . 
recall however that the set of all polynomials of degree n is not a vector space . This is due to the fact that a polynomial of degree n when added or multiplied to another polynomial of degree n , it might produce another polynomial of lower degree
