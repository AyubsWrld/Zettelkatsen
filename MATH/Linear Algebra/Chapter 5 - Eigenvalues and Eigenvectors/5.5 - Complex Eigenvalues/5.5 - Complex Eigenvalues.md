The *Characteristic Equation ( $det(Ax -I\lambda = 0)$ )*  , resolves to having at most *n* roots which are the eigenvalues of the linear transformation . However sometimes these roots may resolve to complex values . Take for example when matrix $A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$   . The characteristic equation for this would be $det(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} \lambda & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda  \end{bmatrix})$  = $\lambda^2 + 1$ . Plugging this back into the equation we get $\lambda^2 + 1 = 0$ , and upon solving for the roots we observe that the roots are complex  ( *i.e. $\lambda_1 = i$ , $\lambda_2 = -i$* ) . However , if we permit $A$ to act on $C^2$ , then  we get the following eigenvectors :  $$i\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -i\end{bmatrix} , -i \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{bmatrix}$$

> Let $A = \begin{bmatrix} .5 & -.6 \\ .75 & 1.1 \end{bmatrix}$ . find the corresponding *eigenvalues* of $A$ and find a basis for each eigenspace . 

**Solution :**  The *Characteristic equation*  of $A$ is equivalent to $(.5 - \lambda)(1.1 - \lambda) - (-.6)(.75)$ = $\lambda^2 - 1.6\lambda + 1$ from the quadratic equation we get $\dfrac{1}{2}$ $[\ 1.6 \ \pm  \sqrt{(-1.6)^2 - 4} \ ]$ = $.8 \pm .6i$  for the eigenvalue $.8 - .6i$ construct $A - (.8 - .6i)I$  = $\begin{bmatrix} -.3 + .6i & -.6 \\ .75 & .3 + .6i \end{bmatrix}$ 

Here's the text converted to latex with equations in $ delimiters for markdown:

$A - (.8 - .6i)I = \begin{bmatrix} .5 & -.6 \\ .75 & 1.1 \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} .8 - .6i & 0 \\ 0 & .8 - .6i \end{bmatrix}$

$= \begin{bmatrix} -.3 + .6i & -.6 \\ .75 & .3 + .6i \end{bmatrix}$ (1)

Row reduction of the usual augmented matrix is quite unpleasant by hand because of the complex arithmetic. However, here is a nice observation that really simplifies matters: Since $.8 - .6i$ is an eigenvalue, the system

$(-.3 + .6i)x_1 - .6x_2 = 0$
$.75x_1 + (.3 + .6i)x_2 = 0$ (2)

has a nontrivial solution (with $x_1$ and $x_2$ possibly complex numbers). Therefore, both equations in (2) determine the same relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$, and either equation can be used to express one variable in terms of the other.

The second equation in (2) leads to

$.75x_1 = (-.3 - .6i)x_2$
$x_1 = (-.4 - .8i)x_2$

Choose $x_2 = 5$ to eliminate the decimals, and obtain $x_1 = -2 - 4i$. A basis for the eigenspace corresponding to $\lambda = .8 - .6i$ is

$\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -2 - 4i \\ 5 \end{bmatrix}$

Analogous calculations for $\lambda = .8 + .6i$ produce the eigenvector

$\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} -2 + 4i \\ 5 \end{bmatrix}$

As a check on the work, compute

$A\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} .5 & -.6 \\ .75 & 1.1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} -2 + 4i \\ 5 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -4 + 2i \\ 4 + 3i \end{bmatrix} = (.8 + .6i)\mathbf{v}_2$

Surprisingly, the matrix $A$ in Example 2 determines a transformation $\mathbf{x} \mapsto A\mathbf{x}$ that is essentially a rotation. This fact becomes evident when appropriate points are plotted.

>  *We begin by deriving the characteristic equation as normal . We then derive the eigenvalues ( roots ) , in this case we used the quadratic equation . Upon deriving the roots , to get the corresponding eigenvectors we set the equation $A - \lambda I = 0$ and express the equations with respect to one another .  Lastly we multiply by a number to remove any fractional values and that leaves us with our final result . *

> The eigenvalues of the real matrix in Example 2 are complex conjugates, namely, $.8 - .6i$ and $.8 + .6i$. The corresponding eigenvectors found in Example 2 are also conjugates: 

$\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -2 - 4i \\ 5 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} -2 + 4i \\ 5 \end{bmatrix} = \overline{\mathbf{v}}_1$

> [!example] 
> If $C = \begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\ b & a \end{bmatrix}$, where $a$ and $b$ are real and not both zero, then the eigenvalues of $C$ are $\lambda = a \pm bi$. (See the Practice Problem at the end of this section.) Also, if $r = |\lambda| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$, then 

$C = r\begin{bmatrix} a/r & -b/r \\ b/r & a/r \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} r & 0 \\ 0 & r \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \cos \varphi & -\sin \varphi \\ \sin \varphi & \cos \varphi \end{bmatrix}$

where $\varphi$ is the angle between the positive x-axis and the ray from $(0,0)$ through $(a,b)$. See Figure 2 and Appendix B. The angle $\varphi$ is called the argument of $\lambda = a + bi$. Thus the transformation $\mathbf{x} \mapsto C\mathbf{x}$ may be viewed as the composition of a rotation through the angle $\varphi$ and a scaling by $|\lambda|$ (see Figure 3).

Finally, we are ready to uncover the rotation that is hidden within a real matrix having a complex eigenvalue.

> Let $A = \begin{bmatrix} .5 & -.6 \\ .75 & 1.1 \end{bmatrix}$, $\lambda = .8 - .6i$, and $\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -2 - 4i \\ 5 \end{bmatrix}$, as in Example 2. Also, let $P$ be the $2 \times 2$ real matrix 

$P = [\text{Re }\mathbf{v}_1 \quad \text{Im }\mathbf{v}_1] = \begin{bmatrix} -2 & -4 \\ 5 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$

and let

$C = P^{-1}AP = \frac{1}{20}\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 4 \\ -5 & -2 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} .5 & -.6 \\ .75 & 1.1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} -2 & -4 \\ 5 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} .8 & -.6 \\ .6 & .8 \end{bmatrix}$

By Example 6, $C$ is a pure rotation because $|\lambda|^2 = (.8)^2 + (.6)^2 = 1$. From $C = P^{-1}AP$, we obtain

$A = PCP^{-1} = P\begin{bmatrix} .8 & -.6 \\ .6 & .8 \end{bmatrix}P^{-1}$

Here is the rotation "inside" $A$! The matrix $P$ provides a change of variable, say, $\mathbf{x} = P\mathbf{u}$. The action of $A$ amounts to a change of variable from $\mathbf{x}$ to $\mathbf{u}$, followed by a rotation, and then a return to the original variable. See Figure 4. The rotation produces an ellipse, as in Figure 1, instead of a circle, because the coordinate system determined by the columns of $P$ is not rectangular and does not have equal unit lengths on the two axes.

Any vector $\mathbf{w}_0$ in the $x_1x_2$-plane (with third coordinate 0) is rotated by $A$ into another point in the plane. Any vector $\mathbf{x}_0$ not in the plane has its $x_3$-coordinate multiplied by 1.07. The iterates of the points $\mathbf{w}_0 = (2, 0, 0)$ and $\mathbf{x}_0 = (2, 0, .1)$ under multiplication by $A$ are shown in Figure 5.
