Suppose we are given some complex number , $z$ , in [[Complex Number Rectangular Form]] and we are ask to convert it into [[Complex Number Polar Form]] . The way we will go about this is as follows . 

We know `Rectangular Form` is given by $z = a + bi$ , and `Polar Form` is given by $z = r(cos(\theta) + sin(\theta)i)$ so we simply must compute the following . 
$r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ 
$\theta = tan^{-1}(\frac{b}{a})$  

Then we simply substitute the values respectively
