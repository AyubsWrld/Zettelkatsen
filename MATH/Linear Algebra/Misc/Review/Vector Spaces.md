A set of vector objects $V$ = $(a , b , c , d)$   is called a vector space if it is closed with respect to linear operations of addition of vectors and multiplication of vectors by scalars . 

Given $a \in V$ , $b \in V$ , implies $a + b \in V$ . Given by [[MATH/Linear Algebra/Misc/Review/Closure]] . 

#### Vector Space Laws
____
1) $a + b = b + a$ ( commutative law) 
2) $(a + b)+c = (b + c)+ a$ (associative prop) 
3) $a + b = b + a$ (Existence of [[Zero Vector]]) 
4) (Existence of the opposite) 
5) (Scaling Property) 
6) $(a + b)c = (b + c)a$ (associative prop) 
7) $(a + b)c = cb + ca$ (Distributive Laws) 
8) $(a + b)c = cb + ca$ (Distributive Laws) 

The mapping is reserved by linear correspondence  , it is a [[Bijection]] 
Suppose $Q^2$ = $\{a_2t^2 + a_1t + a_0\} \rightarrow R^3 =$
$$ 
\begin{bmatrix} 
	a_2\\
	a_1\\
	a_0\\
	\end{bmatrix}
$$


9) $0$ vector is unique 
10) $-a$  is unique $\forall a$
11) $0 \times a = 0$  , $\forall a$
12) $0 \times \lambda = 0$  , $\forall \lambda$ , where lambda is a scalar  
13) $-1 \times a = -a$   


#### In short 
___
A Vector space is simply a collection of elements which can be added together in any order , multiplied by scalars in any order .
