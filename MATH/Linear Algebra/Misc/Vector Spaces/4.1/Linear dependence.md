A set of vectors $\{ e_1 , e_2, \dots , e_n\}$ is called **linearly independent** if a linear combination of these vectors is equal to a zero-vector only when each coefficient of the combination is zero. Otherwise (if a linear combination of the vectors of a set is 0, and at least one coefficient is not 0) the set is called linearly dependent.

A set of vectors $\{ e_1 , e_2, \dots , e_n\}$ is **linearly independent** if there exists some linear combination where at least one of the coefficients is non-zero 

if $a_1e_1 + a_2e_2 ,\dots + a_ne_n   = 0$ *and* one of $a_1, a_2 , \dots a_n \neq 0$  .


#### Proposition (1) 
___
Any set of vectors which contains the zero vector is not linearly independent , because

$1 \cdot 0  + 0 \cdot a_n = 0$  

#### Proposition (2) 
___
Any set of vectors that contains a linearly dependent subset of vectors is itself linearly Dependent . 

#### Proposition (3) 
___
A set of vectors is linearly dependent if one of them is a linear combination of another
