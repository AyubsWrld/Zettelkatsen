Here's a summary of the key concepts from the section on Coordinate Systems in vector spaces:

1. Coordinate Systems:
   - A basis $B = \{b_1, ..., b_n\}$ for a vector space $V$ imposes a coordinate system on $V$.
   - This coordinate system makes $V$ act like $\mathbb{R}^n$.

2. Unique Representation Theorem:
   - For each vector $x$ in $V$, there exists a unique set of scalars $c_1, ..., c_n$ such that:
     $x = c_1b_1 + ... + c_nb_n$

3. Coordinates and Coordinate Vectors:
   - The scalars $c_1, ..., c_n$ are called the coordinates of $x$ relative to basis $B$.
   - The vector $[x]_B = \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ \vdots \\ c_n \end{bmatrix}$ is called the coordinate vector of $x$ relative to $B$.

4. Coordinate Mapping:
   - The mapping $x \mapsto [x]_B$ is called the coordinate mapping.
   - It's a one-to-one linear transformation from $V$ onto $\mathbb{R}^n$.

5. Change-of-Coordinates Matrix:
   - Let $P_B = [b_1 \, b_2 \, ... \, b_n]$ be the matrix with columns $b_1, ..., b_n$.
   - Then $x = P_B[x]_B$.
   - $P_B$ is called the change-of-coordinates matrix from $B$ to the standard basis in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

6. Properties of Coordinate Mappings:
   - Preserves vector addition: $[u + w]_B = [u]_B + [w]_B$
   - Preserves scalar multiplication: $[ru]_B = r[u]_B$
   - Preserves linear combinations: $[c_1u_1 + ... + c_pu_p]_B = c_1[u_1]_B + ... + c_p[u_p]_B$

7. Isomorphism:
   - The coordinate mapping is an isomorphism from $V$ onto $\mathbb{R}^n$.
   - Any real vector space with a basis of $n$ vectors is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$.

8. Applications:
   - In crystallography, bases are used to describe crystal lattices.
   - Coordinates can be used to verify linear dependence/independence of vectors.

9. Graphical Interpretation:
   - Coordinate systems can be visualized as grids in space.
   - Different bases correspond to different grid systems for the same space.

10. Examples:
    - Finding coordinates of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$.
    - Using coordinate vectors to verify linear dependence of polynomials.
    - Determining if a vector is in the span of a given set of vectors.

This coordinate system approach provides a powerful tool for analyzing vector spaces by connecting them to the familiar structure of $\mathbb{R}^n$, allowing for easier computations and geometric interpretations.
