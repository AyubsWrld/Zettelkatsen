> [!example] 
> *Example (l) : Let A be the matrix in (2) above, and let u = $\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 3  \\-2\end{bmatrix}$ . Determine if $u$ belongs to the null space of $A$ , Where $A= \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 & -2 \\ -5 & 9 & 1\end{bmatrix}$ .

> Simply Multiply $Au$ and see if is equivalent to $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$  

> [!important] 
>   The reason this works is mainly because of **Theorem (2)** which states given $m\times n$  Matrix $A$ , any vector which when multiplied by $A$ gives us the zero vector is within Then null space of $A$ , denoted $Nul$ $A$  . 

___

> [!example] 
> *Example (ll) : $Nul \ A$ is a subset of $R^n$ because $A$ has $n$ Columns.  It follows that any vector within the $Nul$ space of $A$ can be multiplied and added to produce another value which is also within the $Nul$ space of $A$ *

> [!example] 
> *Example (lll) : Let H be the set of all vectors in $R^4$ whose coordinates a , b , c , d satisfy the equations $a -2b+5c=d$  and $c - a = b$ . Show that H is a subspace of $R^4$  .*

With this we simply wish to show that $H$ is equivalent to the Zero vector therefore anything which is multiplied by this Matrix is also the Zero vector  

> 1. *Move all the values to the left*
> $$a - 2b + 5c - d = 0$$$$-a -b + c = 0$$

Firstly I think it is very important to mention what a spanning set is
