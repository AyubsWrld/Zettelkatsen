> *Example (2)* : *Let $V$ be the set of all arrows (directed line segments) in three-dimensional space, with two arrows regarded as equal if they have the same length and point in the same direction. Define addition by the parallelogram rule (from Section 1.3), and for each $v$ in $V$ , define $cv$ to be the arrow whose length is $|c|$ times the length of $v$, pointing in the same direction as $v$ if $c \geq 0$ and otherwise pointing in the opposite direction. (See Figure 1.) Show that $V$ is a vector space. This space is a common model in physical problems for various forces.*

> *Example (3) : Let $V$ be the set of all real-valued functions defined on a set $D$. (Typically, $D$ is the set of real numbers or some interval on the real line.) Functions are added in the usual way: $f + g$ is the function whose value at $t$ in the domain $D$ is $f(t) + g(t)$. Likewise, for a scalar $c$ and an $f$ in $V$, the scalar multiple $cf$ is the function whose value at $t$ is $cf(t)$. For instance, if $D = \mathbb{R}$, $f(t) = 1 + \sin(2t)$, and $g(t) = 2 + 0.5t$, then $(f + g)(t) = 3 + \sin(2t) + 0.5t$ and $(2g)(t) = 4 + t$.*
*Two functions in $V$ are equal if and only if their values are equal for every $t$ in $D$. Hence the zero vector in $V$ is the function that is identically zero, $f(t) = 0$ for all $t$, and the negative of $f$ is $-f(t)$.*
*It is important to think of each function in the vector space $V$ of Example 5 as a single object, as just one “point” or vector in the vector space. The sum of two vectors $f$ and $g$ (functions in $V$, or elements of any vector space) can be visualized as in Figure 5, because this can help you carry over to a general vector space the geometric intuition you have developed while working with the vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$. See the Study Guide for help as you learn to adopt this more general point of view.*
