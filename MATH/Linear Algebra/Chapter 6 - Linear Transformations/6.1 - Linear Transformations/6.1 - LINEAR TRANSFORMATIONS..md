- Linear transformations map vectors between two or more planes the plane being mapped from is referred to as the domain of the transformation $T$ . Whereas the plane being mapped to is referred to as the codomain of the transformation $T$ . 
- We say that $T$ transforms the vector $u$ into vector $v$ where $u$ is the *preimage* of $v$ and $v$ is the image of $u$ under the transformation $T$ . 
### $$ T : U\rightarrow V$$
<center> Or </center>
### $$V = T(U)$$
- Common to say $T$ maps $u$ unto $v$ 
- If domain = codomain of $T$ , then $T$ is an operator . 
- If every image has exactly one preimage then $T$ is one-to-one
- The subset of the codomain that consists of all images under the transformation $T$ is called the range $\lambda$ .  if the number of objects within the range coincide with the number of objects within the codomain then $T$ is referred to as being onto . To put this simply everything in the codomain is mapped to has a partner . 
- A transformation which is both *one-to-one* and *onto* is called a bijection 
- A transformation $I : U \rightarrow U$ is called an identity transformation on $U$ if for every vector $u$ from the space $U$ $$I(u)=u.$$
- A Transformation $T : U \rightarrow V$ is Invertible if there exists such a transformation $S : V \rightarrow U$  .
- So the composition of $S\cdot T$ is just the original domain of $T$ 
	- Its like if you went to school and came back home 
- One can use the notion of an identity transformation to rewrite this definition as follows ... $$S \circ T = I_u$$
	- If $S : V \rightarrow U$ is the inverse of $T : U \rightarrow V$ 
- Or the inverse if $S$ is the inverse of $T$ . 
- This transformation is unique . 
- A transformation is invertible if and only if it is one-to-one and onto ( a bijection).

#### Linear Transformations and their matrices 
___
- A transformation is Linear $iff$ 
	1. $T(a + b) = T(a) + T(b)$
	2. $T(\alpha a) = T\alpha(b)$
