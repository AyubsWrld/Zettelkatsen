##### Definition  
___
A `Complex Number` is a number written in the form $$z = a  \ + bi$$
Where $a$ is the *real part* of $z$ , denoted by $Rez$  , and $b$ is the `imaginary part` of $z$   , denoted by $Imz$ , and i is a formal symbol satisfying the relation $i^2 = -1$ 

For Example , suppose $z = 5 + (-2)i$ ..
- It follows that the `real` portion of $z$ , $Rez$ is equivalent to $5$ 
- And the `imaginary` portion of $z$ , $Imz$ is $-2$ , we omit the $i$ 

##### Equivalence 
____
Two complex numbers are considered `equivalent` if both their `real` and `imaginary` parts are equivalent. 

##### Subtraction
____
$z - \bar{z} = 2(Imz)$ 

##### Addition 
____
given two complex numbers, their sum is expressed as follows ...
$z + w = (Rez +Rew) + (Imz+Imw)i$  

##### Multiplication 
____
given two complex numbers, their sum is expressed as follows ...
$z \times w = (ac - bd) + (ad+bc)i$  
That is you simply foil 

##### Inverse 
____
$z^{-1} = \frac{\bar{z}}{|z|}$
