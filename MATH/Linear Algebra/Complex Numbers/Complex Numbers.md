##### Definition  
___
A `Complex Number` is a number written in the form $$z = a  \ + bi$$
Where $a$ is the *real part* of $z$ , denoted by $Rez$  , and $b$ is the `imaginary part` of $z$   , denoted by $Imz$ , and i is a formal symbol satisfying the relation $i^2 = -1$ 

For Example , suppose $z = 5 + (-2)i$ ..
- It follows that the `real` portion of $z$ , $Rez$ is equivalent to $5$ 
- And the `imaginary` portion of $z$ , $Imz$ is $-2$ , we omit the $i$ 

##### Equivalence 
____
Two complex numbers are considered `equivalent` if both their `real` and `imaginary` parts are equivalent.
