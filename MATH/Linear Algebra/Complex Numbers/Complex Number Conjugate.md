The *Conjugate* of any *Complex Number* is denoted by $\bar{z}$ . and is defined by $z = a-bi$ . 
Given this definition ...
- *if* $z = -3 + 4i$ , *then* $\bar{z} = -3 - 4i$ . 

##### Recall Now 
_____
Based off what was previously mentioned , what would $z\bar{z}$ be equivalent to ? 

Recall [[Complex Number Arithmetic]] , it states that multiplying any number which belongs to the set of the [[Complex Number System]] , $Z_1 \times Z_2$ will simply be expanded and result in another number which also belongs to the set $\mathbb{C}$ in the form $z = a-bi$ .  

So given that $Z = -3 + 4i$ and $\bar{Z} =  -3 - 4i$  , then it follows that ...
$$(-3+4i) \times (-3-4i)$$
$$9 -12i + 12i - 16(-1) $$
$$9 -12i + 12i + 16) $$
$$25 -12i + 12i$$
$$25$$

which is just $(a^2 + b^2)$ 

##### What follows 
____
Given that $z\bar{z}$ is both *non-zero* and *non-negative* , it has a square root which is referred to as the [[Complex Number Modulus]] ,  ($|{z}|$)   . 
##### Remembering using the Feynman Technique 
____
The *Conjugate* of any *Complex Number*  is killing its imagination , that is keep the *real part* and get rid of its ability to imagine .
