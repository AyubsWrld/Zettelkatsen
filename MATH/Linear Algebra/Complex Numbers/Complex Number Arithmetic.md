##### Addition 
____
$$(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a+c) + (b+d)i$$

##### Multiplication  
___
$$(a + bi)  (c + di) = (ac - bd ) + (ac + bd)i$$

___
These rules reduce to basic arithmetic when both $b$ and $d$ are zero . Also the usual laws of arithmetic which hold for $\mathbb{R}$ can be extended to $\mathbb{C}$ .  That is multiply each term in $Z_1$ with each term in $Z_2$ and you will arrive at the answer . 
##### Subtraction 
___
Subtraction is denoted by $Z_1 - Z_2$ = $Z_1 + (-1)Z_2$ , and usually we just take the inverse of $Z_2$
