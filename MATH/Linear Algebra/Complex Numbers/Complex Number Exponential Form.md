Given our knowledge of [[Complex Number Polar Form]] , $z = r(cos(\theta) + isin(\theta))$ , where $r$ is simply the [[Complex Number Modulus]]  of $z$ . given [[Eulers Formula]] we can transform the remaining left hand side of the equation to $e^{i\theta}$ . Given that we are left with $z = |z| e^{i\theta}$ , where $\theta = Tan^{-1}(\frac{b}{a})$ .
