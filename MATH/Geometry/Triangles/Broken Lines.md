If lines exist where there endpoints are not colinear , and one endpoint extends from the endpoint of the preceding one , we refer to these as broken lines . these individual lines are referred to as the sides of the polygon . 

A broken line is convex is the entirety of the lines exist on one side of the halfplane by extending any side into a straight line . 

A broken line is closed if the endpoint of the starting line coincides with the endpoint of the last line . creating a polygon . 

Diagonals are formed by connection any lines that are not the endpoints .
