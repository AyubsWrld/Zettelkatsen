In this section, we explore fundamental constructions in Euclidean geometry, which serve as building blocks for more complex constructions. Each construction involves four essential elements: **(i) preliminary analysis, (ii) construction, (iii) proof,** and **(iv) investigation**.

#### a) Constructing an Angle Congruent to a Given Angle
- **Problem Statement**: Given an angle \( \angle CAB \) and a point \( O \) with ray \( OM \), construct an angle congruent to \( \angle CAB \) with vertex at \( O \) and one side along \( OM \).
  
  1. **Construction**: 
     - Draw an arc with center \( A \) intersecting \( AB \) at \( D \) and \( AC \) at \( E \). 
     - From \( O \), draw an arc intersecting \( OM \) at \( P \). 
     - Draw another arc from \( P \) with radius \( DE \) to intersect the first arc at \( Q \). 
     - Draw ray \( ON \) through \( Q \); \( \angle NOM \) is the desired angle.

  2. **Proof**: By SSS (Side-Side-Side), \( \triangle QOP \cong \triangle EAD \), showing \( \angle QOP = \angle EAD \) and establishing \( \angle NOM \) as congruent to \( \angle CAB \).

  3. **Investigation**: The arcs from \( O \) and \( P \) can intersect at two points \( Q \) and \( Q_1 \), providing two solutions for \( \angle NOM \).

#### b) Constructing a Triangle Given Three Sides (SSS)
- **Problem Statement**: Given segments \( a, b, c \), construct a triangle.
  
  1. **Construction**: 
     - Draw a ray from point \( B \) and draw an arc of radius \( a \) intersecting at \( C \). 
     - From \( B \) and \( C \), draw arcs of radii \( c \) and \( b \) respectively to intersect at point \( A \).
  
  2. **Result**: \( AB = c \), \( AC = b \), \( BC = a \) confirms the triangle.

#### c) Constructing a Triangle Given Two Sides and Included Angle (SAS)
- **Construction**: First, construct an angle congruent to the given angle. Then draw arcs from the vertex using the two sides' lengths to define the triangle uniquely.

#### d) Constructing a Triangle Given Two Angles and Included Side (ASA)
- **Exercise for Students**: To be solved independently.

#### e) Constructing a Triangle Given Two Sides and Opposite Angle (SSA)
- **Construction**: 
  - Draw ray \( AM \) and construct \( AN \) such that \( \angle NAM \) is congruent to the given angle \( \alpha \).
  - From \( A \), draw an arc of radius \( b \) to intersect \( AN \) at \( C \). 
  - Draw a circle with radius \( a \) from \( C \) that intersects \( AM \). Depending on the relation of \( a, b, \) and the perpendicular dropped from \( C \) onto \( AM \), there can be:
    - **Two solutions** (Ambiguous Case),
    - **One solution**,
    - **No solution**.

#### f) Bisecting an Angle
- **Construction**: 
  1. Describe an arc from point \( A \) cutting sides of \( \angle BAC \) at \( M \) and \( N \).
  2. From \( M \) and \( N \), draw arcs intersecting at \( P \). 
  3. Line \( AP \) is the bisector.

- **Proof**: \( \triangle AMP \cong \triangle ANP \) implies \( \angle 1 = \angle 2 \).

#### g) Erecting a Perpendicular from a Given Point on a Line
- **Construction**: 
  1. Draw a circle centered at point \( A \) to find points \( B \) and \( C \).
  2. From \( B \) and \( C \), draw arcs to find point \( P \).
  3. Line \( AP \) is the perpendicular.

#### h) Dropping a Perpendicular from an Exterior Point to a Line
- **Construction**: 
  1. Identify points \( B \) and \( C \) on line \( l \) equidistant from point \( A \).
  2. Find point \( P \) such that it lies equidistant from points \( B \) and \( C \) on line \( l \).
