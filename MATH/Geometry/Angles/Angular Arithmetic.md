#### Addition
___
Adding one [[Angle]] to another implies that you take both the angles and make them impose adjacency onto the . They will share a common vertex and two arms . Upon which we will take the uncommon arms and create a new angle which will be the sum of the first two angles . 

Given an angle , $\angle\lambda$ , we can create multiples of said angle through taking an angle congruent to it and performing addition on it .
