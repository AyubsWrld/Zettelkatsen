Two [[Angle]] are said to be [[Congruent]] if one angle can be superposed such that the vertex , $O'$ , lies within $O$ and the corresponding arms $O'A'$ and $OA$ correspond with one another . If the other remaining arms $OB$ and $O'B'$ correspond with one another then the angles are said to be congruent . 

If the Two Angles are not congruent it implies that when one of the arms is laid upon the other , either one of the interiors created by the arms will be less than the other . 

$$\angle{OAB} \lt \angle{O'A'B'}$$

If I have triangles , they are said to be the same if I can take one triangle and rest it upon the other and the bottom triangle is invisible . When we talk about angles we simply have to remember that we are concerning ourselves with only part of the triangle . If I place the triangles on top of one another and the triangle below it is visible it implies that one of the triangles ( in this case the bottom triangle ) is larger than the other
