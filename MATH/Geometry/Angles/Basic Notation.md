An [[Angle]] is a figure formed by two rays that emanate from a common point and do not lie on the same line . The origin is called the **vertex** of the angle and the rays emanating from the origin are called *sides* or *arms* . The arms divide the entire plane into two parts , the *Interior* and the *exterior* .
