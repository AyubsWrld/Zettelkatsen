These are basic primitives which must be taken for granted to derive any further proofs . These are as fundamental as any real number. Their existence is not questioned . 

Usually used as the premises to justify proofs. Given *postulates* $x \ , \ y \  , \ z$  then we arrive at a proof . 


A set of [[Axioms]] must be consistent , That is every Axiom which exists must coexist with every other axiom without a contradiction following 

They must be Independent , No *Axiom* can follow from another 

They must be *Complete* , they must describe everything 


Fundamentally these axioms define the system .
