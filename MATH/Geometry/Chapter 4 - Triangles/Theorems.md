#### An equilateral triangle with a side congruent to a given segment can be constructed.
#### If a triangle has two congruent sides then the angle opposite to these sides are congruent . 
_____
**Proof** :  Let $\triangle ABC$ have the qualities , $AB = CB$ , We wish to prove that the angles opposite to these sides are congruent . 

> **Step (i) , Assess all known variables inherent to the definition of the theorem** :  The Theorem implies that the segments $AB$ and $CB$ are equivalent . 
> **Step (ii) , Assess
