### Key Concepts

1. **Interior and Exterior Angles**:
   - An interior angle of a triangle (or polygon) contains points from the interior of the shape.
   - An exterior angle is formed by extending a side of the triangle, and it is supplementary to the interior angle at that vertex.

2. **Exterior Angles**:
   - Each vertex of a triangle has two exterior angles formed by extending the sides.
   - These exterior angles are congruent as they are vertical angles.

3. **Opposite Interior Angles**:
   - For each exterior angle, there are two opposite interior angles that are not adjacent to it.

4. **The Exterior Angle Theorem**:
   - **Theorem 4.5.1**: An exterior angle of a triangle is greater than either of the two opposite interior angles.
   - **Proof Method**: Use the properties of triangles and congruent angles to demonstrate that the exterior angle must exceed the opposite interior angles.

### Corollaries

1. **Corollary 1**:
   - If one angle in a triangle is right or obtuse, then the other two angles must be acute. This follows from the relationship between exterior and interior angles.

2. **Corollary 2**:
   - There is exactly one perpendicular to a given line through an external point. This is important for understanding the uniqueness of geometric constructions.

3. **Corollary 3**:
   - For any line, there is exactly one isometry (reflection) that maps points across that line.

4. **Corollary 4**:
   - Every point has exactly one symmetric image relative to a given line.

### Important Theorems

1. **AAS Condition (Theorem 4.5.2)**:
   - If two angles and a side opposite one of these angles in one triangle are congruent to the corresponding parts of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

### Problems and Their Implications

1. **Problem 1**: Show that two perpendiculars to the same straight line cannot intersect.
   - **Implication**: This highlights the uniqueness of perpendicular lines, a key property in geometry.

2. **Problem 2**: Determine which angle is greater: ∠ABC or ∠AMC when point M is inside triangle ABC.
   - **Conceptual Understanding**: This relates to the properties of angles and their relationships within triangles.

3. **Problem 3**: Prove the SAA (Side-Angle-Angle) criterion for triangle congruence.
   - **Importance**: Establishes a criterion for triangle congruence based on sides and angles.

4. **Problem 4**: Show that an altitude from the vertex of an acute angle in an obtuse triangle intersects the extension of the opposite side but not the side itself.
   - **Visualize**: Understanding the positioning of angles and sides in an obtuse triangle is crucial for geometric proofs.

5. **Problem 5**: Prove that a point has exactly one symmetric image in a given line.
   - **Uniqueness and Symmetry**: This emphasizes the properties of reflection and symmetry in geometry.

### Visualization and Figures

- Utilize diagrams similar to those mentioned (Figures 4.5.1, 4.5.2, etc.) to illustrate the relationships between angles, sides, and vertices of triangles. Visual aids can significantly enhance understanding of the concepts discussed.
