### **Congruence Theorems**

1. **Congruent Legs Theorem**: Two right triangles are congruent if the two legs of one are congruent to the two legs of the other.
    
2. **Congruent Angle and Leg Theorem**: Two right triangles are congruent if an acute angle and its adjacent leg in one triangle are congruent to an acute angle and its adjacent leg in the other triangle.
    

### **Additional Theorems for Right Triangles**

- **Theorem 4.9.1**: Two right triangles are congruent if the hypotenuse and one leg of one triangle are congruent to the hypotenuse and one leg of the other triangle.
    
    - **Proof**: Superpose the triangles to show congruence through overlap, leading to a contradiction if the hypotenuse does not coincide.
- **Theorem 4.9.2**: Two right triangles are congruent if:
    
    1. The hypotenuse and an acute angle of one are congruent to the hypotenuse and an acute angle of the other.
    2. A leg and its opposite angle of one are congruent to a leg and its opposite angle of the other.
    
    - **Proof**: Superpose the triangles similarly and show congruence by contradiction regarding the alignment of sides.
