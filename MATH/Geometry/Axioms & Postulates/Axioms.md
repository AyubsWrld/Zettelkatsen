axioms are important facts believed to be true without questioning. Axioms , when paired with deductive reasoning are used to form theories and lemmas . 


##### Axiom (1)  : Straightedge Postulate
____
**Given any two points in space, one and only one line can be drawn through these points.**
It follows from *Axiom 1* that if any two points of a line coincide with two respective points of some other line, then these lines coincide in all their points. (Otherwise it would be possible to draw two distinct lines through a given pair of points).

In short , if two lines share the same end points or coincide in more than two different parts,  it implies that they are the same line . From this it is also implied that the lines can only either be the same line , be perpendicular , or intersect at **at most** one part .

##### Axiom (2)  
___
1. *Each segment is congruent to itself*  ,  $a=a$ (Reflexivity)
2. *If one segment is congruent to another , it implies that the second segment is congruent to the first . * , $a = b \rightarrow b=a$ (Symmetry)
3. *If one segment is congruent to the second and that to the third , all the segments are congruent * (Transitivity)
   
##### Axiom (3)  
___
**One and only one segment congruent to a given segment can be laid off a ray starting from the origin** . That is if they have the same starting point from the origin , if they are congruent it implies that they are the same segment (They have the same end and starting point ), otherwise one segment is the larger of the two and the other is the smaller of the two .
