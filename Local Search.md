### Theory

> [!question] What is Local Search ? 

> A search method wherein we utilize a single current state and move to neighbouring states .

> [!question] When should it be applied ? 

>  When the search space is far too large and we have memory constraints . It is very useful for pure optimization problems . 

> [!question] Why should it be applied ?  

> Sometimes we don't care about how we arrive at the solution we more so care about the solution itself . For example within the *N-queens* problem , we concern ourselves with the final configuration of the $n$ queens as opposed to worrying about how we managed to get them in that configuration . With such problems we can utilize *Local Search* 

> [!question] How does it work ? 

>Finds the best state according to some objective function . This is very similar to greedy searches .
