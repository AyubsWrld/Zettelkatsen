- **Socrates** concludes his discussion with **Thrasymachus** on what justice is and whether its even worth partaking in just acts . The conclusion they have arrived to ( Aporia ) does not satisfy the others within the house . 
- **Glaucon** , one of **Socrates** companions proposes a three tiered hierarchical model wherein all good actions fit within one of the these three tiers . These tiers in ascending order are as follows .. 
	- **Things we desire for their consequences** 
	- **Things we desire for thing itself**
	- **And things we desire for both the itself and its consequences**
- **Glaucon** hopes that **Socrates** can prove that justice resides in the highest tier of good . 
- **Glaucon** believes that justice fits among the first group of goods stating that justice is a necessary evil which we allow ourselves to suffer under under so that we can avoid the greater evil which may befall us if we did without justice . 
- **Glaucon** believes that justice stems from human weakness and vulnerability . Since we can all suffer from someone else's injustices we are better off creating some form of social agreement with one another to avoid this . *We only suffer under the burden of justice because we would suffer a greater burden without it. And justice is not something that is practiced for its own sake , rather it is practiced out of fear and weakness.*  
- All this to say that **Glaucon** believes that people would rather act unjustly rather than living justly , even going as far as to claim that living an unjust life is the rational thing to do . 
- **Glaucon** also brings up the story of the *Ring of Gyges* , a fictional ring wherein the wearer becomes invisible . Claiming that if even the most just man were to put the ring on then he too would become unjust . 
- **Social Contract Theory** : 
- **Socrates** begins by purposing two types of justice . the justice belonging to the city or state and the justice belonging to an individual proceeding to claim that it is easier to look for justice on a political level ( city level ) and try to find a connection between the city level and the individual . He constructs a perfectly just city from scratch and try to see where and when justice enters it  .
- **Socrates** presents the foundational principle of human society : the principle of specialization . 
- **The principle of specialization** states that every person must perform the role for which they are naturally best at . The carpenter should only build buildings , the dentist fix teeth , and the shoemaker produce shoes . Behind this principle is the notion that human beings have a natural inclination that should be fulfilled  . 
- Specialization demands not only the division of labor, but the most appropriate such division. Only in this way, Socrates is convinced, can everything be done at the highest level possible.
