**Nodemon** is a development tool for Node.js applications that automatically restarts the server when it detects changes in your code. It simplifies the development process by eliminating the need to manually stop and restart the server after every change.

### Key Features:

- **Automatic Restart**: Monitors files in your application and restarts the server when changes are detected.
- **Easy to Use**: Typically used by running `nodemon app.js` instead of `node app.js`.
- **Customizable**: You can configure it to watch specific files or directories, ignore certain files, and even run specific scripts.

### Example Usage:

bash

Copy code

`nodemon app.js`

This command runs your Node.js application and restarts it automatically whenever you save changes to your files.
