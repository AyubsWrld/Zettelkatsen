#### Key Takeaways 
____
- **Avoid Using Names or Personal Identifiers**:
    
    - Do not request or store the childâ€™s name, email, phone number, or any similar personal identifiers.
- **Use Anonymous Identifiers**:
    
    - Use **temporary** or **random identifiers** (like session tokens) that do not persist across sessions and are not linked back to the child's name, device ID, or account information.
- **Avoid Persistent Identifiers**:
    
    - Ensure that you are not using persistent device identifiers (such as device ID, IP address, or a user account) that can be linked back to the child over time.
- **No Long-term Data Storage**:
    
    - Do not store or transmit data that could later be combined to reconstruct the child's identity. Use only session-based or one-time identifiers that expire after each session.
- **Do Not Tie Data to Guardian Reports**:
    
    - Ensure that reports or notifications to Guardians only show generalized participation status (e.g., "participating" or "not participating") without revealing any identifying information about the child.
