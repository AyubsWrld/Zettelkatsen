### 1. **Familiarize Yourself with Project Structure**

1. **Explore Key Files:**
   - **`AppDelegate.m` / `AppDelegate.mm`**: This file handles application lifecycle events. It’s crucial for integrating native modules and setting up the React Native bridge.
   - **`AppDelegate.swift`**: If you have any Swift files, they handle your Swift-specific logic. You’ll need a bridging header to use Swift with Objective-C code.
   - **React Native Components**: Understand how components like `App.js` or `index.js` interact with your native code.

2. **Understand the Build Process:**
   - Know how React Native builds and bundles your JavaScript code.
   - Understand how native modules are linked and registered.

### 2. **Basic Setup**

1. **Ensure Swift and Objective-C Compatibility:**
   - Make sure Swift files are correctly bridged to Objective-C using a bridging header.
   - Ensure any native modules written in Swift are properly exposed to JavaScript.

2. **Check Dependencies and Configuration:**
   - Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed (React Native, Expo, etc.).
   - Ensure native modules are properly linked and available in your project configuration.

### 3. **Debugging Steps**

1. **Check Module Registration:**
   - Ensure that the native module is registered correctly in the `AppDelegate` file and exposed to JavaScript.

2. **Test Native Code:**
   - Use logging and debugging to confirm that native methods are being called correctly and the module is functioning as expected.

3. **Validate JavaScript Calls:**
   - Ensure your JavaScript code is correctly importing and calling the native module functions.

### 4. **Learning Resources**

1. **React Native Documentation:**
   - Review the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-ios) for native modules and integration.

2. **Swift and Objective-C Guides:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the basics of Swift and Objective-C if you haven’t already.

3. **Expo Documentation:**
   - If you are using Expo, check the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/) for details on integrating with native code.

### 1. **Break Down the Problem**

- **Isolate the Issue:** Focus on the specific problem (like the `TestModule.blockApp` function not being recognized). Try to isolate it by creating a minimal example where you only implement and test this functionality.
  
- **Simplify Your Project:** If your project is large, create a small test project where you can experiment with native modules in a simpler environment. This helps in understanding the issue without other complexities.

### 2. **Learn by Experimentation**

- **Create a Dummy Module:** Build a very simple native module from scratch (e.g., one that just returns a string) and ensure it works. This helps you understand the basics of how native modules are registered and called from JavaScript.
  
- **Tinker with the Code:** Try making small changes to the code to see how they affect the behavior. For instance, modify the `TestModule` to include a very simple method, like returning a static string, and see if it’s accessible in your React Native app.

### 3. **Use Debugging Tools**

- **Enable Logging:** Add print statements or logs in both your JavaScript and native code to trace what’s happening when you try to call the `blockApp` function. This will help you pinpoint where the issue is occurring.

- **React Native Debugger:** Use tools like the React Native Debugger or the built-in React Native DevTools to step through your code, inspect variables, and see what’s being called.

- **Xcode Debugger:** If you're on macOS, use Xcode’s debugger to step through the Swift or Objective-C code to see if your native module is being initialized and used correctly.

### 4. **Consult Documentation and Examples**

- **Official Documentation:** Revisit the official [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-ios) and [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) documentation, focusing on creating and linking native modules.

- **Community Examples:** Look for examples of similar native modules on GitHub or in tutorials. Examining how others have structured their modules and code can provide insights into your issue.

- **Open Source Projects:** Study open-source React Native projects that use native modules. See how they structure their native code and integrate it with JavaScript.

### 5. **Seek Help from the Community**

- **Ask on Forums:** Post your issue on forums like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-native) or [React Native’s GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/discussions). Be specific about your problem and provide code snippets.
  
- **Join React Native Communities:** Participate in React Native Slack channels, Discord groups, or Reddit communities where developers discuss similar challenges.

### 6. **Practice and Learn**

- **Build Small Projects:** Try creating a few small projects that integrate React Native with native modules. This practice will give you confidence and a deeper understanding of how everything fits together.

- **Explore Tutorials:** Follow along with React Native tutorials that cover topics like native module creation, linking, and debugging.

### 7. **Improve Your Swift/Objective-C Skills**

- **Learn the Basics:** If you’re not already comfortable with Swift or Objective-C, spend some time learning the basics. Understanding these languages will make it easier to debug and extend native modules.

- **Focus on Interoperability:** Learn how Swift and Objective-C interact, especially in the context of React Native. This knowledge is essential when working with mixed-language projects.

### 8. **Project Management**

- **Document Your Findings:** As you explore and fix issues, document what you learn. This will be valuable not just for you, but also if you’re working with others or need to revisit the project later.

- **Plan Your Next Steps:** Once you’ve isolated and understood the current issue, plan your next steps, whether it’s adding more functionality, refactoring, or integrating new features.
