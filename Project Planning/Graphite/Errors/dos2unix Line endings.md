/usr/bin/env: use -[v]S to pass options in shebang lines 

This error again indicates that the `detect_python.sh` script has Windows-style line endings (`\r\n`) instead of Unix-style line endings (`\n`).

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Convert Line Endings** Run the following command to fix the line endings for the script:
    
    ```bash
    dos2unix /mnt/e/graphite/esp-idf/tools/detect_python.sh
    ```
    
2. **Check the Script** Ensure the first line (the shebang) of the script is correct and does not have a carriage return (`\r`). It should look like this:
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    ```
    
3. **Convert All Scripts (Optional)** Since multiple files might have Windows-style line endings, it’s better to convert all scripts in the ESP-IDF directory:
    
    ```bash
    find /mnt/e/graphite/esp-idf -type f -name "*.sh" -exec dos2unix {} +
    ```
    
4. **Rerun the Script** After fixing the line endings, try running the script again:
    
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```
    
5. **Ensure You’re Using WSL or a Unix-Compatible Environment** If you’re using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), ensure you’re running the script inside the WSL environment. Avoid mixing native Windows tools with WSL paths, as they can reintroduce Windows-style line endings.
