**Object-Relational Mapping** is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database without explicitly having to write in the language the database was meant to interact with . We can think of an **ORM** as a middle man which sits between your code written in a specific language and the the database . We can then "talk" to this **ORM** in our language of choice and have it interact directly with the database without having to write any , say SQL queries .
