#####  [[implementation.swift]]
____
- This is the implementation file wherein the implementation of the native modules occurs . within this file all the logic for the native module is written . 
- It holds the actual native functionality that you want to expose to the React Native side. This is where the core logic resides.

##### [[objc.m]]
____
- This is an `Objective-C` file which contains the files which are capable of being called by `React-native`  .  The Bridge system allows the JavaScript code to call the code , and this file tells `React-native` how to call the swift code from JavaScript .  
- In short this file declares the methods that are available for use in React Native. It translates the JavaScript calls into something that the Swift code understands.
##### [[NativeAPI-Bridging-Header.h]]
____
- This is the header file which allows `Swift` code to be used within an `Objective-C` environment . Since `React-native`s bridge is written in `Objective-C` , This header file is needed to include Swift code in the bridging process . 
- It tells the Objective-C runtime about the Swift classes and methods that can be used. This file is essential for integrating Swift with Objective-C in projects that involve React Native.

### Refined Analogy:

Imagine you and your friends decide to visit a fancy Russian bakery that’s famous for its exquisite, pre-made pastries. Here’s how the experience unfolds:

1. **The Menu ([[objc.m]]):**
    
    - **What it represents:** The menu at the bakery.
    - **Role:** The menu lists all the pastries that are available for you to order. However, you can only order what's on the menu—no special requests. In our analogy, this menu is like the `Counter.m` file, which defines the exact set of methods (or pastries) that you can order from the JavaScript side in React Native.
2. **The Cashier ([[NativeAPI-Bridging-Header.h]]):**
    
    - **What it represents:** The friendly cashier who takes your order.
    - **Role:** The cashier is bilingual; they understand both English and Russian. When you place your order in English, the cashier takes it and translates it into Russian, which the chef understands. This is analogous to the `NativeAPI-Bridging-Header.h` file, which enables the Objective-C (menu) to communicate with the Swift code (chef). Without the cashier's translation, the chef wouldn't know what to prepare.
3. **The Pre-made Pastries ([[implementation.swift]]):**
    
    - **What it represents:** The pastries that have already been prepared in the kitchen.
    - **Role:** These pastries are like the `Counter.swift` code—they’re the actual products, already made, waiting to be served. The chef (Swift code) doesn’t create new pastries on the spot but simply retrieves and delivers the ones that are already made when the order is understood. The chef follows the exact recipes (pre-written code) and can only provide what’s been prepared.
4. **The Order Process:**
    
    - **What it represents:** You place an order for a pastry from the menu (JavaScript calls a method in React Native).
    - **Role:** You tell the cashier (bridging header) what you want in English (JavaScript), the cashier translates your request into Russian (Objective-C to Swift bridging), and the chef (Swift code) retrieves the appropriate pre-made pastry (executes the logic). The pastry is then handed back to you via the cashier (results passed back to JavaScript).
