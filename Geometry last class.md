every Similarity transformation is a composition of a homothety + isometry ( Prove inverse ) .  Apply a homothety and prove that it achieved through an isometry and homethety . 


Theorem 9.8.1.  If a series of parallel lines intersects two sides of an angle, the corresponding segments cut on the two sides by the parallel lines are proportional.


Problem : Find the 4th proportional : given segments a , b , c , construct segment x . 

: $\dfrac{a}{b} = \dfrac{c}{x}$  if $A_1 \ A_2 // B_1 \ B_2$ : 


Theorem 9.8.2.  If two parallel lines are met  by a pencil (bundle) of lines, the corresponding segments cut off on the parallel lines are proportional


 ***Inscribed angle theorem*** 
 
THIS MAY BE ON AN EXAM !! 

Theorem 9.8.3.  The bisector of an angle of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments  which are proportional to the sides that include the angle


Let BD be a bisector in Triangle abc angle 1 = angle 2 then to prove   $\dfrac{AD}{DC} = \dfrac{AB}{BC}$  let draw ray l parrallel to bc through a itll intersect ray BD at some point E since BC // l other lines through b will intersect l , Andle 3 = angle AED  = angle @ as alternate with // lines angle 3 = angle 1 by theorem 4. EAB is isoceles AE = AB $\triangle ADE \triangle CDB$  by AA ? $\dfrac{AD}{AE} = \dfrac{DC}{BC}$ or since we've proved $AB =AE$ $\dfrac{AD}{AB} = \dfrac{AD}{BC}$ , QED

in $\triangle ABC$ , $\angle C = \angle D$  BC = a l AB = c ; AC = b 

let cd be an altitude $AD = a^1$ ; $BD = a^1$ , $\triangle ACD$
