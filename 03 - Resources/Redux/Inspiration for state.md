Redux is heavily inspired by the **Observer pattern**, along with elements of the **Command** and **Pub/Sub** patterns.
### Here's how Redux maps to the Observer pattern:

|Observer Pattern|Redux Equivalent|
|---|---|
|Subject|The **Redux store**|
|Observer|**Subscribed components** (e.g., React components using `useSelector` or `connect`)|
|Notify observers|`store.subscribe(...)` and automatic re-renders when state changes|
|State change|Triggered via `store.dispatch(action)`|

---

### Flow Recap:

1. You **dispatch** an action (like issuing a command).
    
2. The **reducer** processes it and returns a new state.
    
3. The **store** updates its state and **notifies all subscribers**.
    
4. Subscribed components re-render with the new state.
    

---

So yes, Redux is a practical, scaled-up application of the **Observer pattern** tailored for predictable state updates.

Would you like to see how this looks in a React component with hooks?
