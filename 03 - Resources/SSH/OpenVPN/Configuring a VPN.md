### Summary:

- **With a VPN**: You typically **don't need port forwarding** for communication between devices on both ends of the VPN tunnel. The VPN allows direct communication between devices using their internal private IP addresses.
    
- **Still need port forwarding**: If your device (either local or remote) is behind a NAT or firewall and you want external access to a service on your network, you may still need port forwarding to route the traffic correctly through the router.
    

If you're planning to set up a VPN and want further details on how to configure it with port forwarding (if needed), feel free to ask!
