In networking, tunneling is a method for moving packets across a network using a protocol or path they would not ordinarily be able to use. Tunneling works by wrapping data packets* with additional information — called headers — to change their destination. SSH tunnels use a technique called [[Port Forwarding]] to send packets from one machine to another.
