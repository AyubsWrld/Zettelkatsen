SSH runs on top of the [TCP/IP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/) protocol suite — which much of the Internet relies upon. TCP/IP transports and delivers data packets. The use of TCP is one way that SSH is different from other tunneling protocols, some of which use the faster but less-reliable UDP instead.
