COM makes a fundamental distinction between interface definitions and their implementations.

Client only has to concern themselves with the Interfaces Definitions. Its contract that it conforms to. The actual implementation is up to the discretion of the programmer and defines how the actually functions related to the interface are implemented. the in-memory representation of a pointer to an interface, and therefore its use by a client, is completely determined by the interface definition.
