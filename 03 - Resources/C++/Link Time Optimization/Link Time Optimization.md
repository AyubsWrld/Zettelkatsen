This sentence refers to **compiler optimizations** ‚Äî specifically about how the compiler **can or cannot analyze your code**, depending on how your program is structured and compiled. Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

### ‚úÖ "Ideally the compiler can simply look at the code."

This means:

- If all the code you're calling is **visible** in the current file (translation unit), the compiler can directly **analyze** it and **optimize** things like:
    
    - Function inlining
        
    - Constant propagation
        
    - Dead code elimination
        

Example:

```c
inline int square(int x) { return x * x; }

int main() {
    return square(5); // compiler can easily inline this
}
```

Since `square()` is visible, the compiler can replace the function call with `return 25`.

### ‚ùå "Unless it cannot because you are going across translation units without LTO"

#### What's a translation unit?

In C/C++, a **translation unit** is basically a `.c` or `.cpp` file **after preprocessing**. If you compile multiple source files separately, each one is its own translation unit.

```bash
gcc -c file1.c   # produces file1.o
gcc -c file2.c   # produces file2.o
```

If `file1.c` calls a function defined in `file2.c`, the compiler **can‚Äôt see** its implementation ‚Äî it only sees a **declaration** from the header file.

So it **can't optimize** across those files... **unless** you use:

#### üõ†Ô∏è Link Time Optimization (LTO)

With LTO enabled, the compiler **delays some optimizations** until the linking stage, where it **can see all translation units together**.

So with LTO:

```bash
gcc -O2 -flto file1.c file2.c -o program
```

The compiler can then **optimize across translation units**, including inlining functions defined in other files.

---

### ‚ùå "or are accessing a library"

If you're calling functions from a **precompiled library** (like a `.a` or `.so`), the compiler can't see the implementation.

So:

```c
extern int mathlib_add(int, int); // in a library

int main() {
    return mathlib_add(1, 2); // compiler has no idea what this does internally
}
```

The compiler **can't inline** or optimize the call, because it doesn't know the internal logic ‚Äî it only knows the function signature.

---

### üîÅ Summary

| Case                                 | Can the compiler optimize it? |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| All code in same file                | ‚úÖ Yes                         |
| Code split across files (no LTO)     | ‚ùå No                          |
| Code split across files (with LTO)   | ‚úÖ Yes                         |
| Code in external precompiled library | ‚ùå No                          |

Let me know if you want to go deeper into how LTO works, or how this relates to things like inlining or template instantiation in C++.
