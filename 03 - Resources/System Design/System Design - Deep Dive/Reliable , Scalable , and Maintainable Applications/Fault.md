Occurs when a portion within the system deviates from its intended spec . This is closely related to yet not to be confused with [[Failure]] . We wish to make systems fault tolerant as possible 


## TLDR 
- Faults are when a portion of a system deviates from its intended spec . 
- Different from failures in the nature that faults can have the system still run in their presence whereas failures cause the entire system to stop servicing the user . 
- We can force faults in hopes of testing the reliability of our system. A good example of this is Netflixes Chaos monkey , which is a form of [[Chaos Engineering]] .
