Two hypothesis , A and B . A -> Socratic 

- Faith , meeting between the happy passion and the paradox . Understanding meets the paradox with happy passion becoming faith . 
- As opposed to truth being within and recollected there is untruth within and error  ( sin ) .  No truth and no condition for understanding . 

- The Moment is unimportant in hypothesis A , however in hypothesis B it is like becoming a new person ( Climacus uses conversion ) . Sin to becoming aware of the eternal  . 

- The teacher is unimportant , as they do not give us but bring out what is already within us . Whereas in hypothesis B the teacher gives the ability and condition for understanding.  Teacher is a divine teacher .
- Although Climacus proposes these two hypothesis , he does not convern himself with the validity of each hypothesis . 
- He does not believe he cannot do more than the ironist . 
- What is the significance of climacus name ? 
	- To climb , and if one wants to ascend they must start at the bottom and accept ignorance , where he and socrates both align with one another , they accept their own ignorance 
- They both do not claim to have knowledge . They don't make knowledge claims
