- **Socrates** travels to **Polemarchus'** house where he engages in a conversation with **Polemarchus'** Father , **Cephalous** . 
- **Cephalous** claims that he is fairing quite well with himself growing old , as he says a side effect of his coming of old age is that he is freed from youthful desires . He also makes the claim that only restless and uncalm individuals have problems with growing old  . 
- **Socrates** questions him that perhaps the reason why he is so comfortable with coming of age is because he is wealthy and not his patience . As wealth allows people to be comfortable . 
- Due to **Cephalous'** apparent indifference to wealth , **Socrates** asked whether **Cephalous** acquired his wealth or inherited it , to which **Cephalous** answered that he acquired it himself and that he wanted to pass of more to his children . 
- **Cephalous** Takes his leave , but before doing so he makes claim to what he believes justice is , claiming justice to be always telling the truth and repaying ones debts .
- However **Socrates** quickly dismantles this claim giving a counterexample of returning a weapon to a madman . Although that would by definition be just , it would result in harm being done to the madman or to others . All to say that sometimes repaying debts may be hurtful to the one receiving . 
- **Cephalous** then hands off the argument to his son **Polemarchus** and him and **Socrates** try to arrive at a definition for what justice truly is . 
- **Polemarchus** claims that justice is to do repay debts to your friends and enemies what you owe them ( owing friends help and enemies harm ) . 
- This cannot be the case however **Socrates** argues , because to be able to pay a friend with kindness and an enemy with wrath is contingent on our won ability to discern friend from foe . It is also usually the case we are not always friends with the most virtuous individuals, nor are our enemies always the scum of society. there is also some incoherence to harming people in the name of justice .
