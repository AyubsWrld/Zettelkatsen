What is the Class Invariant problem ? ;; When our compound type is in an semantically invalid state which would cause undefined behavior. 

Why are member functions defined within the body of the class implicitly inlined ? ;; To avoid breaking the one definition rule. 

What should we think about with every class we write ? ;; Are there any state our object could be in that would place our object into a semantically incorrect state. 


What is the difference between structs and classes ? ;; data/function members and implicitly public with structs and implicitly private with classes. 

What should getters return ? ;; They should return by value or by const l-value reference. 


What's wrong with this code ![[Pasted image 20250522224900.png]]? ;; UB, Ref is left dangling after the r-value expression is resolved. 

Why should we refrain from returning non-const references to private members? ;; Because you can directly change the value of the returned reference without having to deal with the access control system. 

True or false: Const member functions canâ€™t return non-const references to data members ? ;; True, intuitively this makes sense because const member functions cannot change the state of the object so it would make sense that there is a mechanism which stops them from returning something which may alter the state of the object. 

Which access layer composes a classes interface , public or private ? ;; Public. A classes "interface" is usually called it's public interface. 

Why shouldn't we utilize the private keyword with respect to structs ? ;; Structs do not and should not be utilized for implementing data hiding as that would defeat the purpose of their use as aggregates ( You usually want to use all the data you defined ). 

What are some benefits of data hiding ? ;; Helps us manage invariants better, also we can remove the concern of having to understand the implementation. We simply concern ourselves with manipulating the interface. It also becomes quite easy to change the implementation of some interface without having to change the interface. 

If we want good class design we should ? ;; Think about where the class invariants might occur and move all those places into private access layer.
