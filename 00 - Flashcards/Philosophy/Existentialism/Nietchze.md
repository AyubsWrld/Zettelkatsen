What was the birth of tragedy about who wrote it? ;; The Birth of Tragedy, written by Fredrich Nietzsche, was a commentary on which in part pointed out how 19-th century thinkers tended to regard Greek culture as "staid and balanced". Ancient Greeks were often viewed as being the "ultimate rationalists" and even seen as a precursor to Christianity. Nietzsche points out this in fact was not the case. 


What were Nietzsche's views on the Ancient Greeks ? ;; Nietzsche believed that the Ancient Greeks weren't Christian's at all as well the notion as viewing them as the "Ultimate Rationalists" was flawed in that it neglected the fact that their culture was infused by a Warriors Ethos. ( " Achilles is not Christ according to him." ).


What is Arete? ;; Martial Excellence. 


What was Nietzsche's central argument in The Birth of Tragedy? ;; That classical Athenian Tragedy was formed by the fusion of two opposing "artistic impulses": the Dionysian and the Apollonian. 


What is the Apollonian ? ;; One of the two "artistic impulses" which Nietzsche claimed sculpted Athenian tragedies. It signified form, structure, order, virtue like a carefully crafted sculpture of Apollo. 

What is the Dionysian ? ;; The opposite of the Apollonian, it represents vitality, pleasure, chaos, intoxication and indulgence. Dionysus energy. 


What did Nietzsche believe was peak Greek Tragedy Literature? ;; When it achieved a perfect albeit tense between the Apollonian and Dionysian forces. It was about looking at the horrors of existence seeing the Dionysian abyss. Through the Apollonian structure of the art form, passionately affirming life anyway it allowed the audience to transcend pessimism through embracing the tragic. 

True or false: for Nietzsche tragedy wasn't just sad, it was life affirming. ;; True.


Altruism ? ;; Altruism's utility became so practical that its origin was forgotten. It came to be praised unconditionally. Usefulness becomes ingrained virtue ? 

What is the Geneology of Morals ? ;; Applying evolutionary thinking to morals but not claiming biological inheritance of values but rather tracing moral's historical and cultural evolution. His idea is that good and evil has complex and winding histories. Challenging the idea that they are based on some eternal transcendental truth. 

What did Herbert Spencer coin ? What were his views on "Good" ? ;; Survival of the fittest, Tried to explain morality through utility. "Good" is what is useful. Actions are good because they benefit the community and over time people just forgot about their origins and took them at face value. 


What is wrong with Morality through utility according to Nietzsche ? ;; Useful to what end ? It assumes what it needs to explain. 

What is the alternative to Morality through Utility ? ;; Genealogical approach of viewing morals.

What is Master morality ? Master morality originates from the ruling class. Those in power defined "good" based on the qualities they themselves possessed and valued—**health, wealth, strength, and power**. To them, _"this is us, this is good."_ In contrast, what they considered "bad" were the opposite traits found in those they ruled: **poverty, weakness, sickness, and powerlessness**.

What is the essence of Master Morality ? ;; It is in essence, a means of self-affirmation what is moral is simply what you are if you are strong and noble. 

For the Masters, the bad... ;; Wasn't seen as evil, it is rather seen as contemptable, beneath notice almost. Not hatred but a dismissal of those who lacked their qualities. 

How does good and evil tie back to Philology? The word for good in German ties back to Wealth and power, whereas bad ties back to simple. ( Peasant Bad , Gentleman Good ). 

What did Darwin's theory of evolution lack ? ;; A robust mechanism of inheritance, this made Lamarckism quite influential. 

How does Slave morality arise ? ;; Arises as a response to master morality originating from the ones being ruled over.

What is Slave Morality ? ;; A reversal of Master Morality

What is the Driving force of Master Morality ? ;; Affirmation. 

What is resentiment ? ;; Ressentiment is the deep-seated resentment and hatred the slave harbors toward the master. Unable to act on this hostility directly, the slave internalizes it. Over time, this festering emotion gives rise to a new moral framework—a reversal of the master's values. What the master calls "good" (strength, wealth, power), the slave condemns as "evil," while elevating his own condition—humility, weakness, and suffering—as moral virtues.

**What is Dionysian impulse?** ;; The Dionysian impulse represents chaos, instinct, intoxication, and emotional excess. It is tied to primal vitality, collective unity, and the dissolution of individual boundaries—an affirmation of life in its rawest, most tragic form.

**Who is Richard Wagner?** ;; A German composer and close friend of Nietzsche early in his career. Wagner influenced Nietzsche's early aesthetic philosophy, but they later had a falling out due to Wagner’s nationalism, antisemitism, and Christian ideals, which Nietzsche came to reject.

**Who is Paul Rée?** ;; A close friend of Nietzsche and an early influence. Rée was a philosopher and proponent of evolutionary and utilitarian views on morality. Nietzsche later critiqued Rée's reduction of morality to usefulness in _On the Genealogy of Morals_.

**What is The Gay Science?** ;; A book by Nietzsche from his “middle period” that explores themes like the death of God, the affirmation of life, and the creative potential of suffering. It introduces the idea of eternal recurrence and contains the famous proclamation “God is dead.”

**What is Priestly Morality?** ;; A variant of slave morality. It is developed by the priestly caste—those who are physically weak but intellectually and spiritually cunning. It promotes values like humility, chastity, and obedience as "good" while labeling strength, pride, and sensuality as "evil."

**What is the key distinction of Priestly Morality?** ;; Unlike spontaneous slave morality, priestly morality is deeply strategic. It manipulates guilt, shame, and conscience to achieve power over the strong through spiritual means. It replaces physical power with moral condemnation.

**What is Passive Nihilism?** ;; A condition where one withdraws from life and meaning after the loss of metaphysical beliefs (e.g., the death of God). It results in resignation, apathy, or seeking refuge in doctrines like Buddhism or Schopenhauerian pessimism.

**What is Active Nihilism?** ;; The drive to destroy old values and create new ones after recognizing their falsity. Nietzsche sees this as a necessary phase in the emergence of the Übermensch.

**What is the Übermensch?** ;; The “Overman” or “Superman” introduced in _Thus Spake Zarathustra_. A figure who transcends traditional morality, creates his own values, and fully affirms life, including suffering and chaos.

**What is Perspectivism?** ;; Nietzsche’s epistemological view that all knowledge is rooted in perspective. There are no objective, universal truths—only interpretations shaped by individual will, context, and power.

**What is Amor Fati?** ;; Latin for "love of fate." It is Nietzsche’s ideal of affirming one’s life and experiences—good and bad—as necessary and meaningful, embracing them as part of one's path to greatness.

**What is the Will to Power?** ;; A core Nietzschean concept: the fundamental drive in all beings not merely to survive, but to assert, expand, and overcome. It underlies achievement, ambition, creativity, and self-transcendence.

**What is Nietzsche's critique of Socrates?** ;; Nietzsche argues that Socrates marks the decline of Greek tragedy and life-affirming culture. By prioritizing reason over instinct, Socrates represents a denial of life’s chaotic, irrational nature.

**Why did Nietzsche break from Wagner?** ;; Wagner's growing nationalism, antisemitism, and Christian themes contradicted Nietzsche’s evolving philosophy. Nietzsche viewed Wagner’s later work as decadent and life-denying.

**What is Nietzsche’s view on guilt and bad conscience?** ;; Nietzsche traces guilt to the internalization of instincts in a civilized society. When external aggression is repressed, it turns inward, creating bad conscience—a sense of debt and moral guilt encouraged by priestly morality.

**What is the origin of punishment according to Nietzsche?** ;; Punishment originally had nothing to do with morality. It emerged from creditor-debtor relationships where pain was used as a mnemonic to enforce memory of a debt. Only later was it moralized.

**What is Eternal Recurrence?** ;; A thought experiment Nietzsche uses to test life affirmation: if you had to live your life over and over eternally, would you say “yes” to it? Those who embrace it demonstrate the highest form of existential courage.

**What is Nietzsche’s genealogical method?** ;; A method of tracing the historical and linguistic roots of moral concepts to expose their contingent, non-transcendental origins. Nietzsche uses this to challenge the supposed universality of values like "good" and "evil."

**What is pessimism for Nietzsche?** ;; Pessimism is not simply a negative view of life, but a deep cultural and existential condition. Nietzsche distinguishes between passive pessimism (e.g., Schopenhauer’s negation of the will) and active pessimism, which can affirm life even in its suffering. He critiques the former as life-denying and calls for a revaluation of suffering as something to be overcome and embraced.

**What is Nietzsche’s critique of Schopenhauer’s pessimism?** ;; Nietzsche admired Schopenhauer’s honesty about suffering but rejected his conclusion that the world is something to be renounced. He believed that to live is to suffer, and the greatness of life lies in affirming it anyway—**Amor Fati**. Pessimism should be transformed into a life-affirming force, not an argument for resignation.

**What is guilt according to Nietzsche?** ;; Nietzsche traces the concept of **guilt** (_Schuld_) to its root in **debt** (_Schuld_ in German). Originally, guilt had no moral connotation; it was simply the obligation to repay a debt, and punishment was a form of repayment. Over time, this material concept became moralized, especially through religious influence.

**How does guilt become moralized?** ;; Through the rise of **priestly morality** and the internalization of instincts, the creditor-debtor relationship becomes spiritualized. People begin to see themselves as sinful or guilty not because of external harm, but because of internal impurity—giving rise to the **bad conscience**.

**What is bad conscience?** ;; Bad conscience arises when natural instincts (like aggression) are suppressed in a civilized society and turned inward. This creates inner torment and the feeling of guilt, which is then manipulated by religion to enforce obedience and suffering as virtue.

**What role does memory play in punishment?** ;; Nietzsche argues that early punishment wasn’t about justice or morality, but about making people remember their obligations. Pain was used as a mnemonic device to ensure debts would not be forgotten.

**What is the ascetic ideal?** ;; The ascetic ideal is the self-denial of pleasure and suppression of instincts, typically found in religious practices. Nietzsche sees it as an expression of **ressentiment** and **spiritual sickness**, a means by which the weak gain power by moralizing suffering and calling it virtue.

**Why does Nietzsche criticize the ascetic ideal?** ;; Nietzsche sees the ascetic ideal as a **life-denying** force. It turns natural drives into guilt, glorifies weakness, and distorts the human spirit. It is a symptom of decadence, not strength. Rather than affirming life, it tries to escape from it.

**How does the ascetic priest gain power?** ;; By moralizing suffering and internal conflict, the priest interprets them as signs of sin and guilt. He provides spiritual meaning and comfort in exchange for submission, channeling the instincts of the sick soul into obedience and devotion.
