#### How does Pausanias Answer the main philosophical question? 
___
Pausanias first distinguishes between heavenly love and from the earthly through means of an analogy. Like there are two Aphrodite's and there are two lovers there are two separate kinds of love. The first being intelligent and void of lust. The second being a superficial kind of love which is more concerned with the physical as opposed to the spiritual.
