Disparity between lover and the beloved makes it that the beloved does not know the lover . King Peasant girl analogy . 

Two scenarios 
- Peasant knows king -> Doesn't love the king out of the sake of love -> Not true love 
- Peasant does not know King -> does not know true self -> Not true love . 
> "Love seeks equality" - Climacus ( Kierkegaard )

#### Reconciling the gap between us and God 
**Two Options**
- *Elevation of the learner*
	- Problem being if the human being can see god as god -> human might be overwhelmed or in admiration . This contradicts love not seeking its own glory . The gap becomes even more apparent . 
- Divine Descending 
	- God takes on the form of a human being WITHOUT a distinguishing mark . God would have to become both . 

#### Paradox of Divine Descent 
___
- Typhon ( Monster w 100 heads ) attempted to overthrow Zeus for supremacy of the universe . Socrates inquires whether he is like Typhon ( creature of pride and arrogance with many wordly appetites \[ Each head craves something wordly \]) ? This appears to be a paradox . In Socrates own self reflection he finds something that is both egotistic and not . 
- The thinker without paradox is like a lover without passion ( Why ? ) . 
- When we seek to understand it is a passion . Paradox gives our understanding something to really sink its teeth into . 
- Thus it is also the highest passion of the understanding to desire an obstacle, despite the fact that the obstacle in one way or another may be its downfall. ( Moth to a flame ) . 
- ==Passion Loves Paradox== 
- Thought is drawn to what it can't understand , like a paradox , but being destroyed in the process ( To seek out what it cannot resolve ) .  Not throwing the passion aside . 
- In talking about love , Climacus also alludes to romantic love . We often get interested in someone because they please something within us ( Sex appeal , Words , etc.. ) . We gratify ourselves at the beginning . However romantic love might begin with self gratification but it goes further than that . Something that starts out with self love leads you to putting yourself aside ( Selfish to Self Sacrifice ) . 

> 	*"Thus it is also with the paradox of romantic love. The individual lives unperturbed, sufficient unto himself, but then the paradox of self-love is awakened through the love of another, the one desired. ==(Self-love lies at the foundation of, or goes to the foundation of, all love, which is why, if we would like to think of a religion of love, it would be just as epigrammatic as true that it would have to assume a condi-tion and accept it as given: that a person loves himself in order to be able to demand that he love the neighbour as himself.)*== The lover is changed by this paradox of love, so that he hardly recognizes himself (this is witnessed to by poets, who are love’s spokesmen, as well as by lovers themselves, in that they allow poets to take only the floor from them, not their passion). So this imperceptibly sensed paradox of the understanding affects a person and his self-knowledge, so he who believed he knew himself is no longer certain whether he is a stranger creature than Typhon, or whether there is not in his being a milder and more divine part"*
- Socratic method -> start out with passion for knowledge -> end up coming to realize how we dont know . 
> *"But what is this unknown thing against which the understanding, in its paradoxical passion, collides, and which, in addition, disturbs even a person’s self-knowledge? It is the unknown. But this cannot be another person, to the extent that he knows what a person is, nor can it be any other thing he knows. So let us call this unknown God. "*
- Ultimately the paradox will be something which requires faith . 
- We lack condition for understanding for knowing the eternal ( Under hypothesis B ) 
- We cannot use worldly evidence to prove God's existence ( No perfect good ) . 
- Conviction in God requires a leap . In the course of trying to get a proof you are left without so you must abandon it and take a leap of passion ( Not discarding , just letting go of a need for proof . ) .
- Truth is ultimately to be found through subjectivity , not objectivity . When you have an answer , the passion leaves . Passion is at its highest in the paradoxical , when we cant understand . 
- Any proof would have to prove divine goodness , which is problematic . 
- Cartesian doll : We let go of it and it stands upright . ( how does this relate ? )
