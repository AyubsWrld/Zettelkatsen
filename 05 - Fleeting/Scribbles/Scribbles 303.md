- **Absolute Paradox** : Absolute sameness and Absolute difference ( God in human form ). 
- **Holy in Error** 
- **We cannot will ourselves to faith** : We lack the condition for understanding . 
- **Faith is given by god to the learner as the teacher** , we cannot arrive upon faith wholly on our own 
- **Faith relies on grasping that concept of absolute difference** 
- **Why isn't faith an act of will ?**

- **Belief is an expression of will, whereas knowledge isn't** : When the evidence isn't certain , there is scope for willing ourselves to believe . 
- **It is because we cannot come to faith by our own will as it implies that we have the condition for understanding , however we can will ourselves to believe** , **Belief** and **Faith** are two different things in this case . ==This all follows from an Epistemic Belief== . 
- **Eyes of faith**

- **Teacher can only be known if**
