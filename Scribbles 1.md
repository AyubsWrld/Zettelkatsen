Approximation historical claims to subjectivity add more and more results ( Climacus ). 

When it comes to Historical research all we get is approximation. 

Infinite interest 

Subjects infinite interest gradually vanishes 

One may become dispassionate through an objective approach.

Lets presume we have objective proofs which match what the theologian claims . does this make faith any easier if you have the objective proofs in hand ? 

> "Could ever have wished to demonstrate" <- go back here 

Makes it more difficult you rely on that authority as opposed to your own conscious endeavours. 

Why is infinite interest ( Inpassioned interest ) 

instead of finding Eternal happiness  in the eternal , to not be widded ( better be illwed than hanged ). 

Putting aside worldly passions <- only found through infinite interest

Objective knowledge is not the same as faith ( Happy passion ). If we take away uncertainty and make everything objective we confuse the accepting the conclusion of a proof with faith. When one is facing uncertainty and one still accepts it requires faith. 


But what happens if the objective truth goes against what the believer believes ? Is he worse off in his beliefs 


When they start looking for proof are they still in love ? Kierkegaard doesn't 

When you start looking for proof that your beloved is worth your love , your love is no longer passionate rather it is based on your reasons. 

To have an infinite interest towards something objective is to put your interest in something constrained. this is what the zealot 

"if passion is posited nonetheless , zealotry ensues , for the infinitely interest.. the fault lies not in the inf



Philisophical arguments are often deductive whereas Historical proofs are based on inductive reasoning. 



"Such a figure would certainly be laughed at" 

Zealots infinite interest fell upon the wrong object , the good in him was he has passion

7 lines from the top "Socratic secret" From having read the apology , Knowledge about what is eternal , socrates does not presume to have such objective knowledge. 

His transformation is not on the basis of. Socrates in a continual passion with the uncertain . He doesn't claim to know , rather always seeking. to be a lover is ,according to diatoma

Even in the case of earthly love . to be in love we are experiencing it in our subjectivity ( inwardness ) . When the relationship it is purely subjective. Although love is subjective you cannot deny the objective aspect. IF you only love the objective body your loving something objective like a zealot . Although your loving more than the body there is something objective. There is an intermediary


For love of any kind subjectiveness/inwardness is required. There doesn't have to be an intermediary.

Millions before Climacus have pointed out the need for objective truths in religion. How does climacus respond 

The speaker isolates the pondering subject and confront the poor sinner and says to him , dare you now to refuse the proof ? 


How does climacus respond to the fact that millions have taken the objective approach? Rhetorical Shower Bath 

unlike polytheism ( Superheroes like zeus ) the relationship in monotheism like Christianity it is completely inward and subjective. Your relating as an individual , your not mediating your relationship through a lot of people. Only in ones subjectivity is a relationship with the eternal found . The eternal is internal. 


One thing is assumed , Christianity is a given. It is assumed we are all Christians. Everyone presumes to have the truth in hand ( Makes everyone speculative philosophers ). This certain certainty in an objective claim . Kierkegaard found it hard for himself to call himself a Christian ( Christianity is to surrender your will and detach yourself from the world ). 

For Kierkegaard uncertainty allows for passion. You cannot be a philosopher if you know everything , to love is to desire which you do not have. Uncertainty is a beneficial task master ( Happy Passion ). 

Then what could Kierkegaard be ? 

What is the synthesis ? It is what the self is. your objective body takes up a certain amount of space. It only exists at this time. It exists in a space and time and time that is unique . The self and the mind is not similarly circumscribed. The self is a synthesis of the temporal and the eternal. You can think of what you are experiencing right now or tomorrow or yesterday . Our thoughts can range beyond the temporal. Something our bodies cannot do the same . 

This synthesis is what your occur when you look inwards. 


Christianity does not lend itself to objectivity, it lends itself to subjectivity to the utmost.
