- ## TLDR
	- Form of [[Fault]] wherein a physical piece of the system (i.e a CPU , Power Supply , ETC) fail causing an impact on the system 
	- Can be handled utilizing redundant systems . Like when a power supply dies there may exist a backup generator which allows for the system to stay online and running . 
- ## Preventing hardware faults
  - We can prevent hardware faults through the use of redundant systems . Just have a bunch of backups so that when one portion of the system fails due to hardware faults , another system can just rely on the backup . Since hardware faults are usually localized and only effect one usually small portion of the system , these sorts of faults are easily handled .
