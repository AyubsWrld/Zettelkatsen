Extensions are like giving an existing class (or struct, enum, etc.) **"superpowers"** without changing its original identity. They add functionality (methods, computed properties, etc.) but keep the type the same. Creating a new class, on the other hand, defines a **completely new type** with its own behaviours and properties.
