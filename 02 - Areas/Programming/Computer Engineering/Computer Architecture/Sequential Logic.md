State based logic , holds some form of memory of previous states . For example traffic lights have correct states. We usually need a clock to determine when we go from one state to another . 

**Clock** is a general mechanism that triggers transition from one state to another in a sequential circuit . 

**Master Slave Flip Flop** : How does it state change on the clock edge and make data available for full cycle . 

**Moore FSM** :Output depends on current State
**Mealy FSM** : Output depends on the current state and the inputs 

**Going from FSM diagram to simplified logic**

**Types of FSMs** : 
- **Fully Encoded** : 
- **1-Hot Encoded** : 
- **Output Encoded** : 

## Asynchronous and Synchronous Reset
- **Asynchronous Reset** : The reset signal is sampled independent of the clock .
- **Synchronous Reset** : The reset signal is sampled dependent on the clock . 
 

**Reading to Memory**

**Multiplexer**

**Decoder** 

**Ports in Memory**

**Sequential circuit timing** :
