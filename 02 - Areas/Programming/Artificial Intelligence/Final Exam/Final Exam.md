1) Representation Pattern
	- **Which Network correctly represents disjoint probability**? Based on the question derive. 
	- The Surprise Candy Company makes candy in two flavours: **70% are strawberry flavour, and 30% are anchovy flavour**. Each new piece of candy starts out with a round shape; as it moves along the production line, a machine randomly selects a certain percentage to be trimmed into a square; then, each piece is wrapped in a wrapper whose colour is chosen randomly to be red or brown. **80% of the strawberry candies are round, and 80% have a red wrapper**, **while 90% of the anchovy candies are square, and 90% have a brown wrapper**. All candies are sold individually in sealed, identical, black boxes. Now you, the customer, have just bought a Surprise candy at the store but have not yet opened the box. Consider the three Bayes nets bellow:
	- This goes from Flavour to Shape and Wrapper . (II) cannot be the case because wrapper and shape occur independently between one another. That is Shape is not dependent on on wrapper.
