A function that assigns truth values to each atomic statement.

> [!example] 
>  $P = \{ a_1 , a_2 , a_3 \}$ where ...
>  $a_1$ = "Ayub's favourite color is blue" 
>  $a_2$ = "The sky is green"
>  $a_3$ = "Glass is safe to eat" 
>  If we take our reality as a model we would get 
>  $M(P) = ( a_1 \wedge \neg a_2 \wedge \neg a_3$ )
>  However in another reality I might like the color red .
