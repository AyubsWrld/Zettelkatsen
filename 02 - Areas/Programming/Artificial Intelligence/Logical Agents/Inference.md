Method of deriving new knowledge from what we already know to be true. 

For example if we know that every time we take a shower our hair gets wet we can turn this into a propositional logic statement. 

$P(x)$ = Take a shower
$P(s)$ = Hair is wet 

$$ P(x) \rightarrow P(s)$$
Now using *Modus Ponens* if we take a shower , that is $P(x)$ evaluates to true we are left with $P(s)$
