A type of search wherein multiple players or agents play against one another. 


### Analogy
---
Imagine playing a game of League of Legends wherein you select Fiora against Renekton. You realize that winning relies on you parrying the Renektons W so you try to think ahead and think about all the possible scenarios in which Renekton might use his W. The principle here is the same with Adversarial Search, through "Thinking ahead" and deducing how you should play the game you can potentially win.
