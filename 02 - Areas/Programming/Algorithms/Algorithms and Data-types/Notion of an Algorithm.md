A finite set of instructions which help us arrive at a solution within a quantifiable amount of time . We usually represent algorithms through the use of [[Pseudo Code]] . This abstracts away most of the semantical problems which are inherent when writing algorithms in a programming language which would just add another layer of difficulty where it is not needed . 

#### Fundamentals of Algorithmic Problem Solving
___
1. Understand the problem 
2. Understand the computational limitations of the system which the algorithm is designed to run on 
3. Choose between exact and approximate problem solving ( Do I need 100% test coverage ?) 
3. Algorithm Design Techniques 
4. Decide on appropriate data structures .
