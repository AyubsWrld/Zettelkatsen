### **Notes on Mistakes and Corrections**

1. **Mistake:** **Incomplete use of the shift table.**
    
    - The purpose of the shift table is to determine how far the pattern can be safely shifted after a mismatch. In your implementation, you referenced it but didn't use it effectively to adjust the index.
    - **Why this happened:** Likely confusion about how the table interacts with the loop.
    
    **Fix:**
    
    - Fully understand the role of auxiliary data structures (like the shift table) in the algorithm's logic.
    - Carefully design how they're built and how they're applied.

2. **Mistake:** **Incorrect loop and index updates.**
    
    - The decrementing of `i` (`i = i - shiftTable[idx]`) didn’t align with the algorithm’s logic. Specifically, the index updates didn’t account for mismatched characters properly.
    - **Why this happened:** Over-simplifying the skipping logic and not accounting for matching the entire pattern.
    
    **Fix:**
    
    - Explicitly define the logic for skipping based on the pattern's size and the shift value.
    - Use comments or pseudocode to map out exact index updates before writing the code.

3. **Mistake:** **Single-character comparison instead of full pattern match.**
    
    - The algorithm is meant to compare the pattern with the substring of the text, starting from the rightmost character. Your implementation only checked individual characters without verifying the whole pattern.
    - **Why this happened:** Misunderstanding of how the pattern matching happens (right-to-left character comparison).
    
    **Fix:**
    
    - Break the problem into smaller parts and focus on one aspect at a time. For example:
        1. Handle right-to-left comparison first.
        2. Then integrate shifting logic.

4. **Mistake:** **Overcomplicating logic without testing edge cases.**
    
    - The algorithm didn’t handle what happens when a mismatch occurs or when the pattern length exceeds the text length.
    - **Why this happened:** Skipping test cases for edge cases (e.g., text shorter than pattern, no matches).
    
    **Fix:**
    
    - Test your implementation with several input cases:
        - Normal input: Text contains the pattern.
        - Edge cases: Text shorter than pattern, no matches, overlapping patterns, etc.

### **General Practices to Avoid Such Mistakes**

1. **Write Pseudocode First**
    
    - Before jumping into coding, write clear pseudocode for your algorithm.
    - Focus on:
        - Input handling.
        - Step-by-step process.
        - Output and return conditions.
    
    **Example for Horsepool:**
    
    ```text
    1. Create the shift table for the pattern.
    2. Start comparing the pattern with the text from right to left.
    3. If a mismatch occurs:
        - Use the shift table to calculate the shift value.
        - Move the pattern by the calculated shift.
    4. If all characters match, return the starting index of the match.
    5. If the end of the text is reached with no match, return -1.
    ```

2. **Understand the Algorithm Intuitively**
    
    - Break down the logic of the algorithm in your own words.
    - Ask yourself: Why does this algorithm work? What is the key idea (e.g., skipping unnecessary comparisons)?
    
    **For Horsepool:**
    
    - "It shifts the pattern so it lines up with the next possible match, using precomputed distances for each character in the pattern."

---

3. **Use Debugging and Tracing**
    - Add print statements or use a debugger to trace key values (e.g., `i`, shift values, substring comparisons).
    - **Example for Debugging:**
        
        ```javascript
        console.log(`Comparing pattern at index ${i}:`, text.substring(i - m + 1, i + 1));
        console.log(`Mismatch! Shifting by:`, shift);
        ```

4. **Test Incrementally**
    - First, ensure smaller parts of the algorithm work (e.g., building the shift table).
    - Then test the entire algorithm with basic examples and edge cases.

---

5. **Keep Algorithm Reference or Diagrams**
    - When learning a new algorithm, draw diagrams or refer to examples that visualize how it works.

---

### **How to Apply This for Future Problems**

1. **Map Inputs to Outputs Early**
    
    - Clarify: _What are the inputs? What should the output look like?_ Write down specific examples.
2. **Work Step-by-Step**
    
    - Don’t combine too many steps at once. Implement and test small sections, such as the shift table or matching logic, before merging them.
3. **Seek Edge Cases**
    
    - Always brainstorm edge cases before coding. Examples for pattern matching:
        - Text shorter than the pattern.
        - Pattern appears at the start, middle, or end.
        - Pattern does not exist in the text.
4. **Review Algorithms from Trusted Sources**
    
    - When implementing algorithms, refer to textbooks or trusted online resources. Ensure you fully understand the algorithm’s steps before implementing it.

With these practices, you’ll not only avoid repeating the same mistakes but also build a strong foundation for approaching algorithms systematically! Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any specific aspect.
