Through giving up some Memory or spending some extra time simply through setting up for a problem , we can significantly lower the time it takes to solve the problem . Notice how we aren't changing the data , instead we are putting in place some independent precursors so that approaching and solving the problem becomes easier . This extra step is referred to as **Input enhancement** .
