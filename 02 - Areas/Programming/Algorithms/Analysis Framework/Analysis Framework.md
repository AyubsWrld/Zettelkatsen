- Both time and space efficiencies are measured as functions of the algorithm’s input size
- Time efficiency is measured by counting the number of times the algorithm’s basic operation is executed. Space efficiency is measured by counting the number of extra memory units consumed by the algorithm.
- The efficiencies of some algorithms may differ significantly for inputs of the same size. For such algorithms, we need to distinguish between the worst-case, average-case, and best-case efficiencies.
- The framework’s primary interest lies in the order of growth of the algorithm’s running time (extra memory units consumed) as its input size goes to infinity.
