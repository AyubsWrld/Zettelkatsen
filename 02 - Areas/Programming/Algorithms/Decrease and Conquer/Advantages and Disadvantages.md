#### **Advantages:**

- Simplicity of recursive solutions.
- Efficiency, especially when decrease by a constant factor is used (as in binary search).

#### **Disadvantages:**

- Recursive solutions may lead to high memory usage due to stack operations.
- Some decrease and conquer algorithms may have higher overhead compared to iterative solutions (e.g., insertion sort vs. merge sort).
