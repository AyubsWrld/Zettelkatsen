1. **Reduction**: The problem size is decreased by a constant amount, constant factor, or variable amount.
    
2. **Solution of a Smaller Problem**: Once the problem size is reduced, the smaller problem is solved using the same technique, often recursively.
    
3. **Solution to Original Problem**: The solution of the smaller problem is extended to provide a solution to the original problem.
