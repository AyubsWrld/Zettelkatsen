#### **1.1 Decrease by a constant**

- The problem size is reduced by a constant amount, usually 1.
- Example: Insertion sort works by sorting a smaller portion of the array and then inserting one new element into the sorted section.

#### **1.2 Decrease by a constant factor**

- The problem size is reduced by a constant fraction, often by dividing the size by 2 or another fixed constant.
- Example: Binary search reduces the problem size by half at each step when searching in a sorted list.

#### **1.3 Variable-size decrease**

- The problem size is reduced by a variable amount depending on the structure of the problem.
- Example: Euclidâ€™s algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) uses variable-size decrease depending on the magnitude of the numbers.
