Used to simplify calculating a value , *A* , to the power of *n* . The trick lies in the binary representation of the value *n* . Any binary number can be expressed as the sum of powers of 2 . For example $3^{13}$ . Similar to [[Horners Rule]] , we reduce the number of multiplications using this method .
