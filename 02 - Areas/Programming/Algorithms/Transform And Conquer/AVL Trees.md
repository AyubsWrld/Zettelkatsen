In a Normal [[Binary Search Tree]] , Values are held within nodes where traversing to the right yields nodes larger than the search value , and traversing to the left yields nodes smaller than the search value . This is all nice and dandy however , we run into a significant problem with balancing when we try to insert and move around values which may lead to [[Imbalances & skewing]] .  **AVL** trees combat this through the use of [[Balance Factor Rule]] . Through this modification **AVL Trees** guarantee search , insert , and removal in **O(logn)** .
