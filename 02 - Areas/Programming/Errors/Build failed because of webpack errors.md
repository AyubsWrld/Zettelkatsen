A build failing due to webpack errors means that during the process of bundling and compiling your project, webpack encountered issues that it couldn't resolve. Webpack is a module bundler used to combine and optimize your project's files (like JavaScript, CSS, etc.). When errors occur, it could be due to things like:

- Syntax errors in your code
- Missing or incorrectly configured dependencies
- Issues with the configuration of webpack itself (e.g., loaders, plugins, etc.)
- Incorrect file paths or imports

These errors prevent webpack from completing the build process successfully, which results in the build failure message.
