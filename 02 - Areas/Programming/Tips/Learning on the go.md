When developing a native module for an application that uses a separate programming language, it’s helpful to approach learning the new language pragmatically. Here's how you might think about it:

### Consider the following:
1. **Understand the Use Case**:  
   Focus on the specific functionality you need to implement in the native module. If the language is only being used for a specific feature or task, you might only need a limited understanding of its syntax and libraries.

2. **Learn as You Develop**:  
   It's often more efficient to learn the language while you are building the module rather than mastering the entire language first. As long as you have a general understanding of programming concepts, you can learn what you need as the development process unfolds. Start by learning the basics of the language, especially how it interacts with your main application.

3. **Leverage Existing Libraries and Resources**:  
   Look for existing libraries or frameworks in the target language that might simplify your work. Often, you won't need to write everything from scratch. As you integrate these libraries, you'll naturally learn the parts of the language that are relevant to your project.

4. **Learn Core Concepts**:  
   Focus on understanding key concepts such as memory management, interfacing with the main application, and how to optimize the module’s performance. These might be specific to the language and its environment (e.g., working with C/C++ for performance in a Node.js module).

5. **Reference Documentation and Guides**:  
   Have the documentation handy to learn things as you hit roadblocks. Practical experience tends to make learning more efficient, as you are solving real problems.

### When to Consider Learning the Language First:
- **Performance and Efficiency**: If the module requires heavy optimizations or needs to be highly efficient (e.g., low-level systems programming), knowing the language well before starting could be beneficial.
- **Debugging Complexities**: If the language has a steep learning curve and you anticipate complex debugging or maintenance issues, spending time upfront to learn it well can save headaches later.
- **Long-term Project**: If you’ll be working extensively with the language beyond this module, investing more time in learning the language first might pay off.

In summary, a balanced approach is usually best—gain enough familiarity to start the project, but learn deeper aspects of the language as needed throughout development.
