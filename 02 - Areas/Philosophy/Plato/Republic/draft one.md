- Special justice is something that everybody's doing what they are best at be it stealing, lying, or harming another to connect to ordinary justice. 
- Plato argues, if society is structured properly, the people will automatically have a just behavior.  

- **Specialized justice = harmony and efficiency**: 
Each person does what he is supposed to be best fit at (farmer farms, doctor heals, guardians protect). 
That rationality creates a well run society because when one would try to harm the others, that would be irrational (which means mutual dependence).  

- **Education shapes virtue** 
Right values spoken at the right age and there is an inclination of him within himself toward justice-nnot justice of adherence to laws but justice of character. 

- **A just city & an individual soul are similar**  
**City will be of three classes**:  
Guardians (rulers) → bwisdom-reason  
Auxiliaries (soldiers) → courage-spirit  
Producers (workers) → moderation-appetite  
**Soul will have three component**:  
Rational (to seek truth) → rule the destiny  
Spirited (formed with courage, willpower) → will support the reason  
Appetitive (associated with desires, pleasures) → has to obey  

- **Justice within the soul = internal order** 
All parts of the soul must perform their own task in order for a person to be truly just. 
When reason leads and appetite is controlled, stealing, lying become unnatural (becomes justification that lying, stealing is unnatural behavior).  

- **Injustice = disorder & self-destruction** 
So when appetite dominates reason, the soul turns chaotic. 
However, a just person understands that injustice harms self as much as others.  
- Everything must be functioning well both in the city and in the soul when every segment plays its role. Deprivation (betrayal, stealing, lying) then disrupts the balance and leads to suffering. True justice is not only law but also harmony between people.  
- **Julia Annas, On Plato's Republic**: Justice is not in action but of people-becoming a certain kind of person. As ordered, the soul of the just naturally trips over any acts of injustice. Justice in the city = performing their specialized job. Justice in the individual = performing their part by each part of the soul.  
- **The Major Assertion of Plato**: - "Justice in the city and the justice in the man is the same.'' Such reservoirs shall agree with all human nature, accepting that they indulge too often in evil actions. An ordered soul, relating to that, will author naturally some form of conventional justice. In addition, if justice is connected to internal peace, it means injustice is «not only wrong but irrational, self-destructive». But doesn't justice == not everyone being able to do anything other than what they are suited for ? "the only option the ruler in Kallipolis has is the following: philosophise and rule or forfeit the opportunity to philosophise in Kallipolis". These rulers are limited in the fact that they can only pursue interests that are predefined for them ( This guy quoted Brown but I lost it )

### Basic flow ( Edit this later pretty messy ngl ) 

- So Plato’s _Republic_ is all about figuring out what justice actually **is**, right? Socrates doesn’t just define it straight up—he builds this whole ideal city to try and **see** what justice looks like in a larger scale before looking at individuals.
    
- The big idea → **Specialized justice** = everyone sticks to their proper role in society. Like, if ur a shoemaker, make shoes. If ur a ruler, rule.
    
- **Ordinary justice** is more what we usually think of—basic moral behavior (no stealing, no lying, no harming others).
    
- Plato’s claim = If specialized justice is upheld, then citizens will naturally be moral in everyday life. But like, why??
    
#### **Specialized Justice in Plato’s Ideal City**

- Society works best when ppl do what they’re best at. No switching roles—stay in ur lane.
    
- Three classes:
    
    - **Guardians** – Philosophers, supposed to be the wisest, make the laws.
        
    - **Auxiliaries** – Soldiers/enforcers, keep order and protect the city.
        
    - **Producers** – Workers, traders, etc. do all the regular jobs.
        
- If each person focuses on their role, the city runs **smoothly**.
    
- Education is a big deal—it’s what **sorts ppl into the right class** and teaches them how to act justly.
    

#### **Ordinary Justice—A Different Thing?**

- At first, it kinda seems like moral behavior (don’t be a jerk) is separate from Plato’s idea of justice.
    
- But Plato says they’re actually **connected**.
    

#### **How Specialized Justice Creates Ordinary Justice**

- Plato’s argument: If ppl just do their jobs and nothing else, society stays **balanced** and ppl won’t feel the need to be unjust.
    
- Why tho???
    
    - **No reason for crime** – If everyone has what they need and is doing what they’re naturally best at, there’s no reason to steal or cheat.
        
    - **Interdependence** – Every class depends on the others. A shoemaker doesn’t need to farm bc the farmers got it covered. If ppl mess with the system, they’re making life worse for themselves too.
        
    - **The Guardians make sure things are fair** – Philosopher rulers don’t even **want** power, but since they have to rule, they do it justly. If the city is just, then unjust behavior isn’t really rewarded.
        

#### **Plato’s Just City = The Just Soul (His Analogy)**

- Plato’s big comparison: The city and the soul have the same structure.
    
- Three parts of the soul match the three classes in the city:
    
    - **Rational** (wisdom, logic, thinking) → The Guardians.
        
    - **Spirited** (courage, ambition, discipline) → The Auxiliaries.
        
    - **Appetitive** (desires, pleasure, basic needs) → The Producers.
        
- A just soul = when reason is in control, keeping desires in check. If the appetites take over, things fall apart (same as in the city).
    
- So if citizens are trained to have just souls, they’ll naturally act morally.
    

#### **How Internal Justice = External Morality**

- A well-ordered soul means a well-ordered person.
    
- If reason is in charge, a person won’t act out of greed or impulse.
    
- Justice isn’t just about rules—it’s an **inner state** that naturally leads to good actions.
    

#### **Education’s Role in All This**

- It’s not just about job training—it’s about shaping a person’s **soul**.
    
- Education makes sure ppl develop the right habits and **internal** justice.
    
- Basically, if the system works, people won’t need external laws to be good. They’ll just **be good**.
    

#### **Conclusion (Or something like it idk yet)**

- Plato’s whole thing is that justice isn’t just about following rules, it’s about inner harmony.
    
- The city’s structure mirrors the soul’s structure, so if the city is just, the ppl in it will be just too.
    
- Specialized justice in society → justice inside individuals → moral behavior.
    
- Is this actually realistic? Idk. But it’s interesting how he sees justice as **more than laws**—it’s a way of life.
    
- Maybe a modern takeaway: Can we create a society that actually makes ppl **want** to be just instead of just punishing them when they aren’t?


#### Rough Rough draft 

( One of the most influential.. philosophy appears in Plato's Republic. Through the dialogue of Socrates, Plato erects the ideal city, a kallipolis, as an extended metaphor for justice within the soul. ) Such an account implies that examining justice on a larger scale would, in fact, bring about a better understanding of justice on the level of the individual ( akward )) . Socrates finally defines justice in the city as all individuals fulfilling the role they are best suited for and not interfering with the fulfilment of others' roles. Such a conception of justice is different from more traditional notions of justice as simply not stealing, lying, or harming. Socrates, however, will insist that the two types of justice are intimately connected: in exercising specialized justice, persons of the just city will also avoid the normal sorts of injustice. The essay will investigate how Socrates tries to show this connection, what mechanisms would in his ideal city maintain justice, and whether any objections can be raised by either his collaborators or modern critics against them.

Socrates' way of examining matters considers justice first in the city and then in the individual. He claims that the city is like the soul, but in larger terms, so that we can identify justice more easily in it. This leads to the construction of an ideal city built upon the idea of specialization-each citizen really doing that work for which he is naturally best. He states: "A city comes to be because none of us is self-sufficient, but we all need many things" (Republic, 369b). Hence, it is specialization that guarantees the efficiency of every aspect of the operation and brings harmony through the assignment of roles based on natural aptitude. As that city goes on to develop, its citizens generally divide into three major classes: rulers, or guardians; auxiliaries; or warriors; and producers, who are farmers, artisans, and merchants. Once this division is established, Socrates states that "doing one's own work and not meddling with what isn't one's own" signifies justice (Republic, 433a-b). Justice, therefore, is the functioning of each class in harmony without interfering with one another.

How has specialized justice come instead of general justice? So says Socrates: through the mere numeral reinforcements. The assurance of labor specialization would attach each citizen to the particular and appropriate task that's best for the performance of all needs. Simply because everyone has what properly is his own, and they work at the kind of work their nature best suits for them, they have no incentive for stealing or lying. In short, "justice is having and doing what is a man's own, and belongs to him" (Republic, 434a).

Interdependence is specialisation. The sustenance of a guardian is derived from a farmer; a farmer, a guardian, for his protection, and all of them depend on producers of goods. When a citizen injures another, that person becomes less dependent, hence, illogical and counterproductive.

Then the educational system is also instrumental in forming a virtuous character. All these things prepare the guardian to be wise and disciplined by strict training in music, poetry, gymnastics, and philosophy. This type of education eliminates greed and other vices which would give birth to the conventional injustice. They receive nothing but stories and teachings that instill a deep-rooted malice against immoral conduct right from early childhood onward (Republic, 386a-392c).

Again the living condition of guardians would minimize the possibilities of injury. In this way, Socrates disascribes the very things that could make them immoral. Guardians will possess what is essential to their needs and will not have private wealth to guard or accumulate. They would practically have no private homes where they could hide goods or keep them so they could not have the ways and the motive of thefts or lies.



### Sources use : 

rlly sucks how i think brown mentioned rulers as being left with no choice to rule ( find where this is pls need to use this in another text that brown referenced perhaps ? ) -> could become useful in arguing for contemporary critic. Probably use Adiemetius  account for why this Isn't the case as well.  

Other stuff I can use : 

" the only option the ruler in Kallipolis ( metaphor for the soul apparently ) has is the following: philosophise and rule or forfeit the opportunity to philosophise in Kallipolis" No real way out and your forced into this. 


"justice is doing what one is naturally and intellectually fit to do"

Furthermore, Socrates might argue that his conception of education nurtures the variety of human capabilities, especially among the guardian class. The training of guardians in dialectic, music, gymnastics, and mathematics prepares them for the development of a rounded and harmonious character. Rather than emphasizing on-special technical training, their emphasis is on all-around development (Kraut 2022).

Although this can just be derived from the text alone I could argue this idk if worth using.
