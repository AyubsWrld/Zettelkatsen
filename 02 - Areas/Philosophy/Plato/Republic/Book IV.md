> ###### Discussions of the guardians happiness 


Adeimantus poses a question to Socrates . Would the Guardians ( the rulers ) not be miserable as they would not have any worldly possessions ? This however is not the goal of the ideal state , we wish to make the entire city happen as opposed to making a single group happy .

> ###### Analogy of the statue . 

In responding to Adeimantus' point that the rulers in the just city would most likely be miserable themselves he brings forth an analogy of the trying to make the worlds most beautiful statue . If we wanted to achieve this goal the aim would not be to make just part of the statue beautiful , rather our aim would be centered around making the entire statue equally as beautiful the best we can . 

The goal then would be to refine the guardians in a way that they would be the best guardians as opposed to offering luxuries that would cause them to cease being guardians .

> ###### Effects of Wealth and Poverty 


**Socrates** highlights the fact that both these extremes are causes of deterioration in the arts . Wealth leads to indolence and carelessness whereas Poverty leads to craftsmen being incapable of acquiring the tools and training necessary to carry out their work . The **Guardians** should ward off society from these adversaries .

> ###### How would we defend ourselves from war ?

The question arises , well if no one has any money , how will we defend ourselves from enemies ? Socrates explains that the people engaging in these wars would be rich themselves , if this is the case then we could just send ally ourselves with another neighboring state and promise them the spoils of war once we won .

The size of the just city should not be too large but not too small either . It should be just right .
