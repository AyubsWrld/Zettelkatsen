- **Aristodemus** is invited by **Socrates** to go to **Agathon's** banquet.
- Some of the attendants are drunk and **Pausanias** raises the concern of drinking excessively two days in a row. To which **Eryximachus** , the physician agrees. **Eryximachus** proposes an intellectual exercise, each of the attendants deliver a speech about love. 
- **Phaedrus** begins by speaking about the ==*antiquity of love*== and how loves main benefit is the strong sense of honor and dishonor it provides. The lover will act virtuously and refrain from cowardice in the face of the beloved. **Phaedrus** even goes as far so to say that if there were an army of lovers and their beloveds they would be unbeatable. 
- **Pausanias**  points out that **Phaedrus** failed to distinguish between **Heavenly** love and **Earthly** love. 
- **Heavenly love** is purely intellectual and untainted by physical attraction. 
- **Earthly love** on the other hand is more so outwardly facing and superficial. 
- **Pausanias** then examines how sometimes love can sometimes be seen as praiseworthy and sometimes it can be seen as disgraceful simply based on its nature and purpose. =="Vulgar" love== is driven by transient desires for beauty, power, and wealth. Whereas love based on the noble qualities of the mind is enduring and virtuous . 
- **Love of the beloved > Love of the lover** 
- **Love as a Voluntary and Virtuous Act** : When lovers share a mutual goal of self improvement and cultivation of noble qualities their love is noble. 
- **The Contrast Between Disinterested and Interested Love** : ==Disinterested Lover== loves purely for virtues sake whereas an ==Interested Lover== seeks to reap some conditional gain. 
- **Eryximachus** agrees with **Pausanias** description of love as being two distinct parts. However, **Eryximachus** Agrees that love exists beyond the human experience. He suggests that love is also present within other fields, mentioning the two opposing components parallels of love within the medical field as being one of health and the other of illness. 
- **Eryximachus'** speech elevates love to a cosmic principle, positioning it as a unifying force that governs not only relationships but the very structure of the universe. 
- **Aristophanes** presents a myth. Humans were once round and had multiple limbs. They were also ambitious and attempted to scale the heavens and oppose the gods. As a punishment , zeus split humans in two and that's how the humans we know today came to be. 
- **Aristophanes** myth is all just alluding to the fact that love is the innate desire to unify ourselves and become whole again through finding our other half. 
- **Agathon** provides a more idealized construction of what love is.
