#### The Absolute Paradox . 
- Can be responded to in two ways 
	1. Faculty of understanding is moved by a desire . The happy understanding $\rightarrow$  "*I accept that I met my limit of understanding , and I'm happy that I've met my passion *"
	2. Unhappy ending : "*I cannot understand this therefore its rubbish*" This is also known as offence $\rightarrow$ "*I cannot understand this , my ego is hurt*"
