Direct communication : 
Indirect communication : 
Double Reflection  :
Contingent Secret :
Essential Secret  :


Our thoughts are continually unfolding , this is where we encounter ourself. 


Objective thinking : If you read the weather today and you observe an objective statement. There is no subjectivity involved . Objective thinking -> direct communication 


Subjective Thinking: Requires indirect communication , you try to interact with someone else's subjective thoughts. Like literature. The author is trying to convey their subjectivity to you. When we try to communicate whats in our thoughts we need indirect communication. Something more than just an objective report. 


Double reflection is comprised of two reflections, the first is when you think about something at an objective level. The latter reflection is seeing how you relate to something subjectively. How we are relating to this subject. Double reflection requires both objective thought and subjective thought ( How you relate to it , How you are going to appropriate it ) . 

A lover : when we communicate our love to somebody we relay an objective statement like " I love you " . However we must convey more than that usually. Our love is our inwardness ( thoughts and subjectivity ). A lover must also convey their subjectivity and whats on the inside ( indirect communication ). 

If a young girl were to long for the wedding day for the comfort it gives her, her husband can see her as partaking as infidelity. Woman yearns for the comforts of married life, Kierkegaard believes this is infidelity. Because if love is love is completely fulfilled it is no longer love. Complete fulfilment extinguishes desire/love. 

Diotima: Love is always something that is unfulfilled 

Essential infidelity : 

Direct communication doesn't always have to keep in mind the readers point of view. The indirect communication must think about the listener. It must be presented in a way that the reader can assimilate

Double reflection involves two modes of thought : Objective and subjective 

This is one of the reasons why Climacus uses a pseudonym. He wants to be able to relay his thoughts better to the reader subjectively.
