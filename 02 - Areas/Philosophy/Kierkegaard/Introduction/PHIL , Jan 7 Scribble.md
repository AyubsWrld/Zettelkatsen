Stages of life and Spheres of existence general ways Kierkegaard thinks about life , Three different stages of life . These Spheres encompass what a person is living for . 
- **Aesthetic** : Living for pleasure , enjoyment , or in the moment  .  $\rightarrow$ Immediacy , experience occurs in the moment you are experiencing it . When The dichotomy between pain and pleasure becomes more pronounced when a person indulges in pleasure more often . ( Living as an aesthete )
	- **Egoism** is closely tied to the Aesthetic sphere , as it relates to our own experience . 
- **Ethical** : Living for a general rule . Not living for oneself but living for something which ___ . The aesthete sometimes may partake in something ethical yet it is out of their own pleasure . Depends a whole lot on our own will to be able to pursue what is good .  
- **Religious** : Closely tied with ethical sphere .  Revolves around surrendering will . Falls under two categories. 
	- **A** : *Socratic Method* , We have the truth within us , all we need is for it to be brought out .  *Truth is imminent within us , it need only be brought out*  . 
	- **B** :  External agent required to arrive at the truth .
