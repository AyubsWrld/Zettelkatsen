Your essay must first describe and discuss the importance of subjectivity in relating to the eternal, including its importance to faith, according to Johannes Climacus in the Concluding Unscientific Postscript. You may also include the Philosophical Crumbs in this discussion of subjectivity, the eternal, and faith according to Johannes Climacus, but you need not do so. Whether or not you include the Philosophical Crumbs, and to what extent, is up to you.
