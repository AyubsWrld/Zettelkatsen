#### Test review  
___
- Why according to Diotima is Love a spirit and not a God ? 
- Alcibiades statue analogy : Socrates is like that he might not be so beautiful on the outside but on the inside he might have a semblance of the divine .  
- Two pronged flute.  Alcibiades says that he has fallen under these spells himself 
- Why does Socrates say that death may be a good thing ? ( Apology ) 
	- Those of us who believe death to be an evil they are certainly mistaken. They cannot know it is bad this is beyond what they can humanly know. 
- Socrates may be ignorant of matters eternal, but what he does suggest he knows is matters of the human psyche. People desire goodness and truth , Socrates helps people through directing them to these goods . 
#### Unscientific Postscript ( Becoming Subjective Chapter)
___
- One becomes subjective through the ethical. Ethical has objective side ( What your explicitly told to do and outwardly conforming to the rule ) and subjective side ( Following the ethical and also being moved by it through their love for it ). 
- When the ethical is felt that way it is part of being subjective. 
- ==Subjectivity is not relativism== , It is about where someone comes to know , in inwardness. 
- Ethical can be an occasion when someone puts away their desires for some ethical obligation. This is submitting to the ethical.
- ==Infinite interestedness==, is a movement of faith that allows individuals to put aside worldly desires in favour of the ethical. The ethical can be directed at something outward but it is felt inward. 
- The ethical isn't an abstraction and it is not objective. It is only ethical if it is felt and it moves you. Ethical must also move you towards itself. 

> "Abstraction which is the human race" 

- Ethical is meant to move us. It is an experience and individual. Since the ethical is meant to be experienced it must be experienced at an individual. 
- Although the ethical may be stated as an abstraction. It is also concrete and is tangible. 
- "The Ethical is co-consciousness with god"
	- We are conscious with the ethical in the way God is conscious with the ethical. One must FEELS as if it is the right thing to do. When one sees the ethical as that , feeling its rightness , its goodness , so much so that it compels one to act. That is what is means to be conscious with the ethical in the way God is conscious with the ethical. 
- The ethical doesn't appear purely objectively , we don't feel it. Not only is the relationship to God as lord it also occurs in ones subjectivity. 
- To feel God is lord over you occurs subjectively. 
- King has a theatre but it is privately only contingently. This isn't the case with God however. God can be a spectator. 
- Relating to God subjectively, being observed ( different from the previous passive of co-conscious ). Subjectively we can always act in the presence of the God. We cannot hide our thoughts and emotions in our mind. 
- ==Agathon : Why not feel shamed in front of everyone, Feeling shamed before the wise ==
- One can feel the ethical more if they become aware that they are being observed by God.
- Theatre of ones mind. 

> "Is this question of immortality a learned question" 

- The question of immortality is not a scholarly question. It is a question of inwardness. One can raise the question of immortality subjectively. Are we able to relate with immortality subjectively so that we can detach ourselves from worldly desires. 
  
- One is able through passion to forego worldly passion 
- Consciousness of my immortality occurs within me.
- The proof of immortality is not which has as its conclusion the human soul is immortal. The proof of immortality lies within the interestedness. So becoming subjective is also a means of gaining awareness of becoming immortality. 
- No objective proof will never give us certainty. One can objectively know about immortality of the soul however when their death comes around they might be afraid. 
- Does Socrates relate to the eternal with certainty? 

#### Unscientific Postscript ( Subjective Truth Chapter)
___
- Becoming subjective so that we can detach ourselves from worldly desires. 
- Truth is subjectivity. When it comes to truth as it relates to human 

>" Great care must be taken with thought of being" 

- We tend to think of truth as a its correspondence to reality ( correspondence theory ). 
- This however does not work for Kierkegaard. 
- The relation of something linguistically expressed and the truth of its subject matter renders the self out of its definition. 
- I encounter my experiences subjectively, when the question of truth...
- When the question is purely objective, subjectivity is not 
- Double reflection, considering the concept objectively , and then observing how it relates to you. 
- Subjective reflection is necessary as human.
- Truth requires deeper reflection. 
- ==The fantastical I-I . Truth is dialectical ==
- To become frivolously 
- The I-I is the subject and object. 
- Kierkegaard 
- My senses deceive me is only known through way of my senses. 
- Powerful Evil Demon deceiving us, I must exist to be deceived. 
- There must be an agent thinking in existence for there to be thought. 
- For Descartes, there is a subject ( experiencing the thoughts ) and an object ( the actual person experiencing the thought ). 
- We think of people of more than just an object but also their subjective experiences. 
- For Kierkegaard we are both the subject and the object unseparated. So we are oneself. 
- The self is the subject ( that which is aware ). 
- ==Lack of inwardness is madness. If one proceeds purely objectively.== LOSS OF SELF.
