Approximation historical claims to subjectivity add more and more results ( Climacus ). 

When it comes to Historical research all we get is approximation. 

Infinite interest 

Subjects infinite interest gradually vanishes 

One may become dispassionate through an objective approach.

Lets presume we have objective proofs which match what the theologian claims . does this make faith any easier if you have the objective proofs in hand ? 

> "Could ever have wished to demonstrate" <- go back here 

Makes it more difficult you rely on that authority as opposed to your own conscious endeavours. 

Why is infinite interest ( Inpassioned interest ) 

instead of finding Eternal happiness  in the eternal , to not be widded ( better be illwed than hanged ). 

Putting aside worldly passions <- only found through infinite interest

Objective knowledge is not the same as faith ( Happy passion ). If we take away uncertainty and make everything objective we confuse the accepting the conclusion of a proof with faith. When one is facing uncertainty and one still accepts it requires faith. 


But what happens if the objective truth goes against what the believer believes ? Is he worse off in his beliefs 


When they start looking for proof are they still in love ? Kierkegaard doesn't 

When you start looking for proof that your beloved is worth your love , your love is no longer passionate rather it is based on your reasons. 

To have an infinite interest towards something objective is to put your interest in something constrained. this is what the zealot 

"if passion is posited nonetheless , zealotry ensues , for the infinitely interest.. the fault lies not in the inf



Philisophical arguments are often deductive whereas Historical proofs are based on inductive reasoning. 



"Such a figure would certainly be laughed at" 

Zealots infinite interest fell upon the wrong object , the good in him was he has passion

Even in the case of earthly love . to be in love we are experiencing it in our subjectivity ( inwardness ) . When the relationship it is purely subjective. Although love is subjective you cannot deny the objective aspect. IF you only love the objective body your loving something objective like a zealot . Although your loving more than the body there is something objective. There is an intermediary


For love of any kind subjectiveness/inwardness is required. There doesn't have to be an intermediary.

Millions before Climacus have pointed out the need for objective truths in religion. How does climacus respond 

The speaker isolates the pondering subject and confront the poor sinner and says to him , dare you now to refuse the proof ? 


How does climacus respond to the fact that millions have taken the objective approach? Rhetorical Shower Bath 

unlike polytheism ( Superheroes like zeus ) the relationship in monotheism like Christianity it is completely inward and subjective. Your relating as an individual , your not mediating your relationship through a lot of people. Only in ones subjectivity is a relationship with the eternal found . The eternal is internal. 


One thing is assumed , Christianity is a given. It is assumed we are all Christians. Everyone presumes to have the truth in hand ( Makes everyone speculative philosophers ). This certain certainty in an objective claim . Kierkegaard found it hard for himself to call himself a Christian ( Christianity is to surrender your will and detach yourself from the world ). 

For Kierkegaard uncertainty allows for passion. You cannot be a philosopher if you know everything , to love is to desire which you do not have. Uncertainty is a beneficial task master ( Happy Passion ). 

Then what could Kierkegaard be ? 

What is the synthesis ? It is what the self is. your objective body takes up a certain amount of space. It only exists at this time. It exists in a space and time and time that is unique . The self and the mind is not similarly circumscribed. The self is a synthesis of the temporal and the eternal. You can think of what you are experiencing right now or tomorrow or yesterday . Our thoughts can range beyond the temporal. Something our bodies cannot do the same . 

This synthesis is what your occur when you look inwards. 


Christianity does not lend itself to objectivity, it lends itself to subjectivity to the utmost. 


Kierkegaard asserts that truth cannot be fully understood in an abstract, detached manner. Instead, truth demands personal appropriation by the individual, which involves subjective experience. Subjectivity, in Kierkegaard's view, is not relativism or mere personal opinion; it is the deep inwardness that shapes one’s relationship with truth. For Kierkegaard, becoming subjective means engaging with truth not just objectively, but with a passionate, inward commitment. This is especially true when it comes to faith, which, unlike objective knowledge, cannot be proven or empirically verified. Faith requires a subjective leap—an inward commitment to the eternal that transcends the logical and the objective.

However, Kierkegaard’s conception of subjectivity also involves **double reflection**. This means that, while one may consider a concept objectively, they must also reflect on how that concept relates to them personally. For example, the ethical, which may be presented as an objective rule or principle, becomes truly ethical only when it is subjectively experienced, when one feels moved by it and acts in accordance with it from within. In this way, subjectivity is not just about emotional engagement or blind passion; it is a reflective and conscious inward experience that brings the individual into relationship with the eternal.

In this framework, the eternal cannot be accessed solely through objective reasoning or external proof, because such reasoning would strip the individual of their inward engagement with the truth. Instead, the eternal must be encountered through subjective experience, where one is both subject and object—reflecting on their own inwardness while acknowledging the relationship with the eternal truth. Thus, subjectivity is the means by which the individual relates to the eternal, specifically through faith, and it is through the subjective appropriation of the eternal that one finds genuine meaning and relationship with the divine.
