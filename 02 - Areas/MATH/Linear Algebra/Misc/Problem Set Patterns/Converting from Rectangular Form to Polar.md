Suppose we are given some complex number , $z$ , in [[Complex Number Rectangular Form]] and we are ask to convert it into [[Complex Number Polar Form]] . The way we will go about this is as follows . 

We know `Rectangular Form` is given by $z = a + bi$ , and `Polar Form` is given by $z = r(cos(\theta) + sin(\theta)i)$ so we simply must compute the following . 
$r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ 
$\theta = tan^{-1}(\frac{b}{a})$  

Then we simply substitute the values respectively 

### Example
___
*Suppose $z= 1 + i$*

*Polar form :  $z = r(cos(\theta) + sin(\theta)i)$ *

*Compute the magnitude*
$z = \sqrt{a^2 +b^2}$
$z = \sqrt{1 + 1}$
$z = \sqrt{2}$


*Compute the argument*
$tan(\theta) = \frac{b}{a}$
$\theta = tan^{-1}(\frac{1}{1})$
$\theta = tan^{-1}(1)$
$\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$

*Polar form :  $z = \sqrt{2}(cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) + sin(\frac{\pi}{4})i)$*
