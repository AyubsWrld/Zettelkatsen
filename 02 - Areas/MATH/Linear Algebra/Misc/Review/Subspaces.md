A vector subspace is a subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space under the same operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. To be a subspace, the subset must satisfy three conditions:

1. **Non-emptiness**: It must contain the zero vector.
2. **Closed under addition**: The sum of any two vectors in the subset must also be in the subset.
3. **Closed under scalar multiplication**: The product of any vector in the subset and a scalar must also be in the subset.

If these conditions are met, the subset is considered a vector subspace. Every other condition is automatically met .
