Another way of representing a Number . A Vector , denoted by some letter within the English alphabet and an arrow ( $\vec{A}$ ) , contains a magnitude , or how much of something there is . As well as a direction relative to some axis . 

When we speak about vectors you can think about it like when your giving instructions to individuals on how to arrive at a destination . For example , imagine we playing a game of Simon Says . Simon instructs you to take 4 steps to the right , Had he have only instructed you to take four steps you would be confused , likewise with the direction . However through delineating both the direction and how many steps you are taking everything becomes unambiguous .  As we want all numbers to be .
