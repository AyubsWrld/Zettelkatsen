#### The Characteristic Equation
___
The scalar equation $\text{det}(  A - \lambda I) = 0$ . So the scalar $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of an $n\times n$ matrix $iff$ $\lambda$ satisfies the characteristic equation . $det(A - \lambda I) = 0$  , That is all values of $\lambda$ which make the equation $\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0$ .


#### A cool note on finding the determinant 
___
This excerpt explains how to compute the **determinant** of an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ using its **echelon form** $U$, which is obtained through row replacements and interchanges. The key idea is that the determinant of $A$ can be calculated by:

$\det(A) = (-1)^r \cdot (\text{product of pivots in } U)$ 

where:
- $r$ is the number of row interchanges performed to reach $U$.
- The "pivots" are the non-zero diagonal entries $u_{11}, u_{22}, \dots, u_{nn}$ in $U$.

If $A$ is invertible (i.e., has full rank), the pivots are all non-zero, and the determinant is the product of the pivots multiplied by $(-1)^r$, accounting for the row interchanges.

If $A$ is not invertible (i.e., some pivot is zero), the determinant is zero, since at least one diagonal entry (pivot) will be zero.

### Why This Works:
- **Row interchanges** change the sign of the determinant. Thus, for $r$ row interchanges, the factor $(-1)^r$ adjusts for the changes.
- **Row replacements** and echelon form preserve the determinant except for row scaling (which is not done here), meaning the product of pivots in the upper triangular matrix represents the determinant.

This method is efficient because it avoids recursive expansions and focuses on the transformed triangular matrix's diagonal elements.
