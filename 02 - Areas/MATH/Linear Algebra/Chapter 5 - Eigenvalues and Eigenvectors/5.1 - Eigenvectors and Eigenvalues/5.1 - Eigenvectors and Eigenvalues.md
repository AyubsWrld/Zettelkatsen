#### What is an eigenvector ? and what is an eigenvalue ? 
___
> [!note] 
> An eigenvector of an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is a nonzero vector $x$ such that $Ax =$ $\lambda x$ for some scalar $\lambda$ . A scalar $\lambda$ is called an eigenvalue of $A$ if there is a non-trivial solution $x$ of $Ax$ =  $\lambda x$ ; such an $x$ is called an eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda$. 

#### What is the Eigenspace ? 
___
> [!note] 
> The set of all solutions $x$ such that $(A - \lambda x) = 0$ is  called the solution set is a subspace of $R^n$ is called the $\text{eigenspace}$ of $A$ corresponding to $\lambda$. The $\text{eigenspace}$ consists of the zero vector and all the eigenvectors corresponding to the $\lambda$.
