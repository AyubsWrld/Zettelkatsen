> This summary covers the main theoretical concepts, theorems, and examples presented in the text, providing a comprehensive overview of the dimension of vector spaces and related topics in linear algebra.


1. Dimension of Vector Spaces:
The text discusses the concept of dimension in vector spaces. It states that for a vector space $V$ with a basis $B$ containing $n$ vectors, $V$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. The number $n$ is an intrinsic property of $V$ called its dimension, independent of the chosen basis.

2. Theorem 9:
This theorem generalizes a result about $\mathbb{R}^n$ to any vector space. It states that if a vector space $V$ has a basis $B = \{b_1, ..., b_n\}$, then any set in $V$ containing more than $n$ vectors must be linearly dependent.

Proof:
- Consider a set $\{u_1, ..., u_p\}$ in $V$ with $p > n$.
- The coordinate vectors $[u_1]_B, ..., [u_p]_B$ form a linearly dependent set in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
- There exist scalars $c_1, ..., c_p$, not all zero, such that $c_1[u_1]_B + ... + c_p[u_p]_B = 0$.
- This implies $c_1u_1 + ... + c_pu_p = 0$, proving linear dependence.

3. Dimension Theorem:
If a vector space $V$ has a basis of $n$ vectors, then every basis of $V$ must consist of exactly $n$ vectors.

4. Definition of Dimension:
- For a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, $\dim V$ is the number of vectors in any basis of $V$.
- The dimension of the zero vector space is defined as zero.
- If $V$ is not spanned by a finite set, it is infinite-dimensional.

5. Examples:
- $\dim \mathbb{R}^n = n$
- $\dim P_2 = 3$ (space of polynomials of degree $\leq 2$)
- $\dim P_n = n + 1$ (space of polynomials of degree $\leq n$)
- The space $P$ of all polynomials is infinite-dimensional

6. Subspaces:
- Any linearly independent set in a subspace $H$ of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ can be expanded to a basis for $H$.
- $\dim H \leq \dim V$ for any subspace $H$ of $V$.

7. The Basis Theorem:
For a $p$-dimensional vector space $V$ ($p \geq 1$):
- Any linearly independent set of exactly $p$ elements in $V$ is automatically a basis for $V$.
- Any set of exactly $p$ elements that spans $V$ is automatically a basis for $V$.

8. Null Space and Column Space:
- $\dim(\text{Nul } A)$ = number of free variables in $Ax = 0$
- $\dim(\text{Col } A)$ = number of pivot columns in $A$
