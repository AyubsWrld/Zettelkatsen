> Chapter 4.3 focuses on the concept of linear independence and the notion of a basis for a vector space \( V \) or its subspace \( H \). Let’s break down the key points from the section step by step. 
### Linear Independence
**Definition:**  
A set of vectors $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_p\}$ in a vector space $V$ is said to be **linearly independent** if the only solution to the equation 
$$[c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \ldots + c_p v_p = 0]$$

is the trivial solution $c_1 = c_2 = \ldots = c_p = 0$. If there exists a nontrivial solution (i.e., at least one $c_i \neq 0$), then the set is **linearly dependent**.

**Key Properties:**
1. A single vector $v$ is linearly independent if and only if $v \neq 0$.
2. A pair of vectors $\{v_1, v_2\}$ is linearly dependent if and only if one is a scalar multiple of the other.
3. Any set containing the zero vector is linearly dependent.
### Theorem on Linear Dependence
**Theorem 4:**  
An indexed set $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_p\}$ with $v_1 \neq 0$ is linearly dependent if and only if at least one vector $v_j$ (with $j > 1$) is a linear combination of the preceding vectors $v_1, \ldots, v_{j-1}$.

This theorem emphasizes the relationship between linear combinations and linear dependence, providing a crucial tool for identifying dependence in larger sets of vectors.

### Examples of Linear Independence and Dependence

1. **Example 1:**  
   Consider polynomials $p_1(t) = 1, p_2(t) = t, p_3(t) = 4 - t$. Here, $\{p_1, p_2, p_3\}$ is linearly dependent because $p_3$ can be expressed as a combination of $p_1$ and $p_2$.

2. **Example 2:**  
   The set $\{\sin t, \cos t\}$ is linearly independent in $C[0, 1]$ (the space of continuous functions on $[0, 1]$) because one cannot express $\cos t$ as a scalar multiple of $\sin t$. However, $\{\sin t \cos t, \sin^2 t\}$ is dependent because of the identity $\sin 2t = 2 \sin t \cos t$.

### Definition of a Basis

**Definition:**  
A set of vectors $B = \{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_p\}$ is called a **basis** for a subspace $H$ of $V$ if:
1. $B$ is linearly independent.
2. The span of $B$ coincides with $H$ (i.e., $H = \text{Span}(B)$).

This means every vector in $H$ can be written as a linear combination of the vectors in $B$, and no vector in $B$ can be formed by a linear combination of the others.

### Examples of Bases

1. **Example 3:**  
   The columns of an invertible $n \times n$ matrix $A$ form a basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$ because they are linearly independent and span $\mathbb{R}^n$.

2. **Example 4:**  
   The standard basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the set of column vectors $e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n$ of the identity matrix.

3. **Example 6:**  
   The set $S = \{1, t, t^2, \ldots, t^n\}$ is a basis for the polynomial space $P_n$ since it spans the space of polynomials of degree at most $n$ and is linearly independent.

### The Spanning Set Theorem

This theorem provides a method for constructing a basis from a spanning set by removing unnecessary vectors.

**Theorem 5:**  
Let $S = \{v_1, \ldots, v_p\}$ be a set in $V$, and let $H = \text{Span}(S)$.
- If one of the vectors $v_k$ is a linear combination of the others, then removing $v_k$ still spans $H$.
- If $H \neq \{0\}$, some subset of $S$ is a basis for $H$.

### Finding Bases for Null Space and Column Space

The examples demonstrate how to find bases for the null space and column space of a matrix:

- **Example 8:** The nonpivot columns of a matrix are linear combinations of the pivot columns. By discarding these nonpivot columns, you find a minimal spanning set that forms a basis for the column space.
  
- **Example 9:** Similar reasoning applies for a matrix that is not in reduced echelon form. You can still determine which columns can be discarded based on their dependence on other columns.

### Summary of Important Concepts

1. A basis is a minimal spanning set—one that spans the space but is as small as possible.
2. A basis is also a maximal linearly independent set—one that is linearly independent but can't be enlarged without losing independence.
3. The pivot columns of a matrix form a basis for the column space of the matrix.

### Visual Representation

Figures, such as graphs of functions or illustrations of bases in $\mathbb{R}^3$, can help to intuitively grasp the concepts discussed, highlighting the relationships between vectors and their spans.
