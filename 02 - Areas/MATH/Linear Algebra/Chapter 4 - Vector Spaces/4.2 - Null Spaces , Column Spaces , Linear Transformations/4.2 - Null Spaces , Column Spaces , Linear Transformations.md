- **Null Space** and **Column Space** are subspaces of **$R^n$ . 
- The set of all Solutions to the homogenous equation $Ax=0$ is the null space . We can express this in terms of a couple of spanning vectors which span the entirety of of the **Null Space** . Remember in an $R^{mxn}$ matrix , the null space must be $n$ variables . 
- We express it in terms of the number of Free Variables . Replace free variables with one . 


###  1. Introduction to Subspaces:
   - Subspaces of $R^n$ typically arise in two ways:
     a) As the set of all solutions to a system of homogeneous linear equations
     b) As the set of all linear combinations of specified vectors
   - This section compares these two descriptions and introduces new terminology

### 2. The Null Space of a Matrix:
##### Definition: For an $m \times n$ matrix $A$, the null space is:
     $$Nul A = \{x : x \text{ is in } R^n \text{ and } Ax = 0\}$$
     
   - It's the set of all solutions to the homogeneous equation $Ax = 0$
   
   > [!important] 
> A **homogeneous system** of linear equations is a system where all of the constant terms are zero. In other words, it is a system of the form:
> $$Ax=0$$


   - Theorem 2: The null space of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ is a subspace of $R^n$
   - Proof involves showing that Nul $A$ satisfies the three subspace properties:
     a) Contains the zero vector
     b) Closed under addition
     c) Closed under scalar multiplication

### 3. Explicit Description of Nul $A$:
   - Found by solving $Ax = 0$ and expressing the solution in terms of free variables
   - The resulting vectors form a spanning set for Nul $A$
   - This spanning set is automatically linearly independent
   - The number of vectors in the spanning set equals the number of free variables

### 4. The Column Space of a Matrix:
   - Definition: For an $m \times n$ matrix $A = [a_1 \cdots a_n]$, the column space is:
     $Col A = Span\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$
   - It's the set of all linear combinations of the columns of $A$
   - Theorem 3: The column space of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ is a subspace of $R^m$
   - Col $A$ can be written as $\{b : b = Ax \text{ for some } x \text{ in } R^n\}$

### 5. Contrast Between Nul $A$ and Col $A$:
   - Nul $A$ is a subspace of $R^n$, while Col $A$ is a subspace of $R^m$
   - Nul $A$ is implicitly defined, Col $A$ is explicitly defined
   - Finding vectors in Nul $A$ requires row operations, while Col $A$ vectors are readily available
   - Nul $A = \{0\}$ iff $Ax = 0$ has only the trivial solution
   - Col $A = R^m$ iff $Ax = b$ has a solution for every $b$ in $R^m$

### 6. Kernel and Range of a Linear Transformation:
   - A linear transformation $T: V \to W$ satisfies:
     a) $T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)$ for all $u, v$ in $V$
     b) $T(cu) = cT(u)$ for all $u$ in $V$ and all scalars $c$
   - Kernel (or null space) of $T$: set of all $u$ in $V$ such that $T(u) = 0$
   - Range of $T$: set of all vectors in $W$ of the form $T(x)$ for some $x$ in $V$
   - For matrix transformations, kernel = null space, range = column space

### 7. Applications:
   - Subspaces often arise as kernels or ranges of linear transformations
   - Example: Solutions to homogeneous linear differential equations form the kernel of a linear transformation
   - The differentiation operator is a linear transformation
   - The solution set of $y'' + \omega^2y = 0$ is the kernel of a specific linear transformation
