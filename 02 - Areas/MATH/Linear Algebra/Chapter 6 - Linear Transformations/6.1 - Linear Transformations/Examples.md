#### Example (1) 
___
> [!example] 
> A function given by the expression $y = x^3$ is a transformation from $\mathbb{R}$
( domain) into $\mathbb{R}$ ( codomain). It is one-one (bijective) 

#### Example (2) 
___
> [!example] 
> A function y = sinx is a transformation from R into R.
It is not one-to-one, since every image has infinitely many preimages; for instance
if sinx=a, then sin(x+2JZ')=a, sin(x+4JZ')=a, sin(x+6JZ')=a, ....
Also, this transformation is not onto since -1 < sin x < 1 , so the range is just the
segment [-1,1]. For example, y = 5 is not an image of any number under this
transformation. 
#### Example (3) 
___
> [!example] *One-To-One* ? *Onto*? 
> Let Transformation $T : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ ( $\mathbb{R}^3$ is the codomain and $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the domain of $T$ )  . be defined by the formula ... $$T = \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}\right\} = \begin{bmatrix} 2^x \\ y \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$$ This transformation is not unto , since the first entry of an image , $2^x$ , is always positive ; therefore some vectors ( Namely negative vectors ) from $R^3$ are not images of any vectors in the domain . and recall we need everything in the domain to be mapped to at least one object in the codomain for it to be onto . 

#### Example (4) 
___

> [!example]  *One-to-One* ? *Onto*?
> Example 4. Let us consider an example of a transformation $T:R^2 \to R^2$ given by the formula:
$T\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 - 3x_2 \\ -x_1 + 4x_2 \end{bmatrix}$ (3)

Let us determine
(i) whether this transformation is onto, and
(ii) whether it is one-to-one. 

Solution. In order to determine if $T$ is onto, we have to find out whether an arbitrary vector

$v = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}$ (4)

from the codomain $R^2$ is the image of some vector

$u = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix}$ (5)

from the domain $R^2$. That means we have to determine whether for any $x,y$ there exist such $x_1,x_2$ that

$T\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 - 3x_2 \\ -x_1 + 4x_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}$ (6)

The last vector equation is equivalent to the system

$x_1 - 3x_2 = x$
$-x_1 + 4x_2 = y$ (7)

Let us solve this system with respect to $x_1,x_2$ by row reduction of the augmented matrix:

$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 | x \\ -1 & 4 | y \end{bmatrix} \xrightarrow{R_2 \to R_2 + R_1} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -3 | x \\ 0 & 1 | x+y \end{bmatrix} \xrightarrow{R_1 \to R_1 + 3R_2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 | 4x+3y \\ 0 & 1 | x+y \end{bmatrix}$

It follows from the RREF of the augmented matrix that the system has exactly one solution for each vector $(x,y)$ of the codomain:

$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 | 4x+3y \\ 0 & 1 | x+y \end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow x_1 = 4x+3y \Leftrightarrow \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 4x+3y \\ x+y \end{bmatrix}$ (8)

The solution of the system (7) exists for every vector $(x,y)$ of the codomain, therefore each vector of the codomain is the image of some vector; hence the transformation is onto.

The formula (8) shows that there is exactly one solution $(x_1,x_2)$ for every $(x,y)$; therefore the transformation is one-to-one.

Thus the transformation is one-one (a bijection).

One can see what we mean by saying that bijective (one-one) transformations are invertible: formula (8) describes the transformation inverse to $T$: it recovers the preimage for every image obtained by applying $T$ to the domain.

> If a row reduced matrix has dependent variables it is both not one to one nor onto 

#### Example (6) 
___
Let us consider a composition of two matrix transformations (transformations that are generated by matrices multiplied by vectors): transformation $A: R^3 \to R^2$ defined by

$A(u) = A\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \ u_2 \ u_3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & -1 \\ 3 & 2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{bmatrix}$

and transformation $B: R^2 \to R^2$ defined by

$B(v) = B\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \ v_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}$

By definition, their composition $C: R^3 \to R^2$ ($A$ followed by $B$) is defined as follows:

$C(u) \equiv (B \circ A)(u) = B(A(u)) = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & -1 \\ 3 & 2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{bmatrix}$

We can use the associativity of matrix multiplication to rewrite this as

$C(u) = \begin{pmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & -1 \\ 3 & 2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}\end{pmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -2 & -1 & 1 \\ 13 & 8 & 10 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{bmatrix}$

The latter equality determines how $C = B \circ A$ acts on the vectors of $R^3$. It is easy to notice that the composition $A \circ B$ cannot be defined in this case.
