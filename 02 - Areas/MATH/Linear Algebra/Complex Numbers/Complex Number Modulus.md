Whenever a complex number $z$ is multiplied by its [[Complex Number Conjugate]] , the resulting *Real Number's* square root is referred to as the Modulus of $z$ which is the magnitude of the complex number  , denoted $|z|$ .  

This magnitude is arrived at utilizing the following logic...
$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{b}{r}$$
$$\cos(\theta) = \frac{a}{r}$$
$$a= r \times \cos(\theta)$$
$$b= r \times \sin(\theta)$$
$$a^2 + b^2= r^2 \times (\sin(\theta)^2 + cos(\theta)^2)$$
*The latter halve of the equation resolves to zero using the [[Trigonometric Identity]] **the square of sine of a particular angle added to the square of cosine of same angle always results in 1**.*

$$a^2 + b^2= r^2$$
$$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = r = |z|$$
