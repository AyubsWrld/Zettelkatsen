Proof:
Let l and m be two parallel lines in a plane.1
Let t be a transversal to line l. This means that t intersects l.12
Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that t is not a transversal to line m. This means that t does not intersect m.1
Since t intersects l but not m, and l and m are parallel, then t and m must also be parallel.3
However, both l and t pass through the point where t intersects l.4
This means there are two distinct lines, l and t, passing through the same point, both parallel to m.4
This contradicts Axiom 5 (Playfair's formulation of the Euclidean Parallel Postulate), which states that only one line can be drawn through a given point parallel to a given line.45
Therefore, the assumption that t is not a transversal to m must be false.
Therefore, if two lines in a plane are parallel, a transversal to one of them is a transversal to the other.6
Q.E.D.


> [!example] 
> How many lines parallel to a given line can be drawn in a plane?  

The sources provide the necessary information to answer this question. **Only one line can be drawn parallel to a given line through a given point in a plane**. This is a consequence of **Axiom 5, the Parallel Postulate**. This postulate is a fundamental principle of Euclidean geometry, and it sets it apart from other forms of geometry.

If you were to try and draw more than one line through the given point that is parallel to the given line, you would arrive at a contradiction. The parallel postulate guarantees the uniqueness of a parallel line through a point.

**Therefore, in a plane, only one line parallel to a given line can be drawn.**
