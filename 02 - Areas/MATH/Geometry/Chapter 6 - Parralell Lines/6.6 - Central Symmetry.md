#### Definitions 
-  If two points $A$ and $A'$ are collinear and equidistant from a point $O$ , the points are referred to as being *symmetric* about this point and $O$ is referred to as the *center of symmetry* . This type of symmetry is called central . 


> [!note] **Theorem**
> **6.6.1 :** Given a center of symmetry , each point in the plane has exactly one symmetric image about the centre

**Proof Method** : Construction  
**Proof Outline** : We simply lay off a segment beyond $AO$ such that $OA'$ is equivalent to $AO$ and then through *Axiom 1* , we know that line is distinct and by *Axiom 4* , there is only one point $A'$ on the ray extending the segment $AO$  beyond $O$ such that $AO$ = $OA'$ . Then $A$ is unique . 


> [!note] **Theorem**
> **6.6.2 :** If for two points ( A and B ) their symmetric images ( A' and B' ) about a given center ( O ) are constructed then . 
> 		(i)  The segment joining the points ( A and B ) will be parallel and equal to the segment joining their images (A´ and B´);
> 		(ii) for each point of the segment connecting the given points (A and B), its symmetric image lies on the segment (A´B´) connecting the images of the given points.


(i)  
	**Proof Method** : Direct Proof 
	**Proof Outline** : We show that $\triangle AOB$  = $\triangle A'OB$ by $SAS$ . Then $A'B' = AB$ and $\angle OAB$  = $\angle OA'B'$ . The latter angles are alternate for $AB$ , $A'B'$ and their transversal $AA'$ . Then $AB // A'B'$ *QED*  . 
(ii)  
	**Proof Method** : Direct Proof
	**Proof Outline** : Pick a point, $D$, on $AB$ and draw a line through $D$ and $O$ till it cuts $A´B´$ at some point $D´$. $AO$ = $OA´$; $α = β$ as alternate, $γ$ =$\phi$  as vertical; hence $ΔAOD$ = $ΔA´OD´$. Therefore, $OD´ = DO$, and $D´$ is the symmetric image of $D$ about $O$, $Q.E.D$.

> [!note] **Theorem**
> **6.6.3 :** Symmetry in a point is an isometry.
