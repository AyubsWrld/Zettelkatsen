Given two geometric figures, $S_1 , S_2$ , if there exists some [[Isometry]] , $F(x)$ , Such that $F(S_1) = S_2$  , then $S_1$ and $S_2$ are said to be *Congruent* .

##### Problem (1)
___
**Let $F_1$ . $F_2$ , and $F_3$ be some geometric figures . given that $F_1$ = $F_2$ and $F_2 = F_3$ , prove $F_1 = F_3$**

> *for this problem we must remember the primitive definition of [[Congruence]]. Two `Geometric figures`  are referred to as being **Congruent** given that there exists some isometry , $R$ , such that $R(S_1) = S_2$  .  so for this problem we simply must use the concept of Congruence to prove this . 

Given that $F_1 = F_2$ , there exists an isometry , $R$ , Such that $R(F_1) = F_2$   . 
Given that $F_2 = F_3$ , there exists an isometry , $S$ , Such that $S(F_2) = F_3$   . 
Therefore $F3 = S(F_2) = S(R(F_1))$ ,  and there exists some isometry Such that $T(F_1) = F_3$ . $\therefore F_1 = F_3$
