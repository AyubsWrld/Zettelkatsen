In geometry, an isometry is a transformation that preserves the distances and angles between points, meaning the shape and size of a figure remain unchanged after the transformation, such as through translation, rotation, or reflection. Isometries can be placed into types . 
##### Type(i) Isometry $\rightarrow$ Transformation
##### Type(ii) Isometry $\rightarrow$ Rotation
##### Type(i) Isometry $\rightarrow$  Reflection
