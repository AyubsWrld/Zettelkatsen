### **Theorems**
1. **Theorem 4.10.1a**: A point on the perpendicular bisector of a segment is equidistant from the endpoints of the segment.
  
2. **Theorem 4.10.1b**: A point on the bisector of an angle is equidistant from the sides of the angle.

### **Proofs**
- **Proof of Theorem 4.10.1a**: Given a line passing through the midpoint of a segment perpendicularly, show that distances from the point to segment endpoints are equal.
  
- **Proof of Theorem 4.10.1b**: Use congruent triangles formed by dropping perpendiculars from the point to the sides of the angle.

### **Converse Theorems**
1. **Theorem 4.10.2a**: If a point is equidistant from the endpoints of a segment, it lies on the perpendicular bisector of the segment.
  
2. **Theorem 4.10.2b**: If a point is equidistant from the sides of an angle, it lies on the bisector of the angle.

### **Inverse Theorems**
- **Theorem 4.10.3a**: If a point is not on the perpendicular bisector, it is not equidistant from the segment's endpoints.
  
- **Theorem 4.10.3b**: If a point is not on the angle bisector, it is not equidistant from the angle's sides.

### **Corollaries**
- **Corollary (a)**: The perpendicular bisector of a segment is the locus of points equidistant from the endpoints.
  
- **Corollary (b)**: The bisector of an angle is the locus of points equidistant from the sides of the angle.
