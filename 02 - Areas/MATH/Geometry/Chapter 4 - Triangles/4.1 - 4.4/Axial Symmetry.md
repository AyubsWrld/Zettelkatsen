Symmetry in a line occurs when two points, like P and Q, are mirrored across that line. They are on opposite sides, the same distance from the line, and lie on a perpendicular to the line. To create a symmetric point, say for point A and line MN, you reflect A across MN. The new point A′ appears on the opposite side of the line. 

When you draw a line connecting A and A′, it meets MN at point B. The angles ∠ABN and ∠A′BN are both 90° because the reflection ensures these angles are congruent and supplementary. Since the distance from A to B is equal to the distance from A′ to B, A and A′ are symmetric.

In simpler terms, reflecting a point across a line means finding its "mirror image" on the other side, ensuring both points are equally far from the line and lie on a straight path that crosses the line at 90°.

This idea also extends to entire shapes. If a shape looks the same after being reflected across a line, that line is called the axis of symmetry, and the shape has axial symmetry. For example, when you look at a butterfly, its wings on both sides of its body are mirror images, making the body an axis of symmetry.

In short, symmetry happens when a reflection across a line creates a perfect mirror image, and axial symmetry means a figure can be divided into two identical halves along a specific line.
