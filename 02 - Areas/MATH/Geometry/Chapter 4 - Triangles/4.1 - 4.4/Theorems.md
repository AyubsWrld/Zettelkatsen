#### An equilateral triangle with a side congruent to a given segment can be constructed.
#### If a triangle has two congruent sides then the angle opposite to these sides are congruent . 
_____
**Proof** :  Let $\triangle ABC$ have the qualities , $AB = CB$ , We wish to prove that the angles opposite to these sides are congruent . 

> **Step (i) , Assess all known variables inherent to the definition of the theorem** :  The Theorem implies that the segments $AB$ and $CB$ are equivalent . 
> **Step (ii) , Assess What is stated by the latter half of the statement : $\angle{A}$ = $\angle{C}$
> **Step (iii) , Prove using primitives that the latter follows from the former using axioms**  : $\angle{B}$ is congruent unto itself (Axiom 2) , then by Axiom 4 ( Compass Postulate ) , $\dot A$ falls unto $\dot C$ , then $CA$ will fall unto $AC$ Thus the angle $\angle{BCA}$ will coincide with angle $\angle{BAC}$ making them congruent to one another Q.E.D .
