Polygons with three sides ( notation $\triangle$ ) . The length of their sides group triangles into equivalence classes . If the triangle has no equivalent sides it is **Scalene** , **Isosceles** if two of the sides are congruent , and **equilateral** if all three sides are congruent . 

#### Isosceles 
- The two sides which are congruent are referred to as the lateral sides 
- The remaining side is the base
  
#### Scalene
- The two sides which are congruent are referred to as the lateral sides 
- The remaining side is the base
#### Equilateral


#### Angle Classification 
---
Triangles can also be classified through their angles they form 

#### Right Angled Triangle
- Triangle which contains a right angle , the side which is opposite to the right angle is called the hypotenuse and the other two sides are call the legs . 

#### Obtuse Angled Triangle
- One angle is obtuse 
#### Acute Angled Triangle
- all angles are acute.
