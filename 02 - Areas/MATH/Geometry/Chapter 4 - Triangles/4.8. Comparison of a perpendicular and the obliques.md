1. A perpendicular can be dropped from any exterior point unto a line . (Theorem ?) 
2. The resulting segments are called Projections . 
3. Any line which is dropped from the exterior point unto a projection is called an oblique

##### _Theorem 4.8.1._ A perpendicular drawn from an external point to a given line is less than any oblique drawn to the same line from the same point.
___
Consider $\triangle ABC$ only one angle can be a right or obtuse angle  ( *Theorem 4.5.1*) ,  $\angle CDB = d$ and it follows that $d \gt \angle ACB$  , Hence by *Theorem 4.6.1* $AC\gt AD$  .  Greater side lays on greater angle ? 

##### _Theorem 4.8.2._ If a perpendicular and two obliques are drawn to a line from the same external point, then 
___
> (i) if the feet of the obliques are equidistant from the foot of the perpendicular, then the obliques are congruent; 

> (ii) if the feet of the obliques are not equidistant from the foot of the perpendicular, the oblique whose foot is farther from the foot of the perpendicular, is greater than the other oblique
