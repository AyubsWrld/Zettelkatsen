- **Chapter 4 Key Concepts (Sections 4.5 - 4.10)**
    - **Congruence of Triangles:** Include the four tests for congruence: SAS, ASA, SSS, and SAA. You should also include the Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) test for right triangles.
    - **Inequalities in Triangles:** Note theorems relating sides and angles, like the theorem stating that the greater side is opposite the greater angle, and vice versa.
    - **Properties of Isosceles Triangles:** Note theorems related to the base angles, the bisector of the vertical angle, and other properties.
    - **Loci and Axial Symmetry:** Include the definition of loci and the properties of axial symmetry.
    - **Important Constructions:** Include steps for constructing perpendiculars, bisecting segments and angles, and other key constructions from Chapter 5.
- **Chapter 5: Constructions in Neutral Geometry**
    - **Axioms and Tools:** List the permissible tools (straightedge and compass) and the axioms governing constructions.
    - **Key Construction Problems:** Include solved examples of various constructions, particularly those highlighted as important in the source.
- **Chapter 6: Parallel Lines**
    - **Euclidean Parallel Postulate:** Include both the original formulation and Playfair's formulation.
    - **Tests for Parallelism:** Note the different ways to determine if lines are parallel based on angles formed by a transversal.
    - **Angles with Respectively Parallel Sides:** Include theorems about the congruence or supplementarity of such angles.
    - **Angle Sum of a Triangle:** State the theorem and its proof.
- **Chapter 6, Section 6.4**
    - **Angles with Mutually Perpendicular Sides:** Include relevant theorems and how to evaluate these angles.

**General Tips for Your Cheat Sheet:**

- **Focus on Concepts, Not Just Formulas:** While formulas are helpful, prioritize understanding the underlying concepts and theorems.
- **Organize Clearly:** Use headings, bullet points, and diagrams to make your cheat sheet easy to navigate.
- **Practice Using It:** The best way to ensure your cheat sheet is effective is to practice using it to solve problems.

Remember that your cheat sheet is just a tool to aid your memory. The most important thing is to understand the material and be able to apply the concepts.
