**Example :**  If a triangle has two congruent sides then the angle opposite to these sides are congruent . 

**Steps to solving** $\dots$
___
> **Step (i)** : Identify what the latter portion of the conditional states . 
> **Step (ii)** : Prove whether the latter portion follows from what's implied by the former portion of the conditional . Use these as givens . 
> **Step (iii)** : Use Axioms to relate the former to the latter
