**Construction Problems in Geometry**

1. **Axiomatic Foundations**: 
   - In plane geometry, constructions are based on postulated instruments: the straightedge and the compass.
   - These tools form the basis of geometric constructions, and their use is justified by axioms.

2. **Straightedge Postulate (Axiom 1)**: 
   - Allows for the drawing of lines connecting points and extending segments into straight lines.

3. **Compass Postulate (Axiom 3)**: 
   - Enables the drawing of circles with a specified radius centered at a given point and the transfer of segments along rays from that point.

4. **Limitations on Tools**: 
   - The use of other drawing tools, such as drawing triangles or rulers, raises questions about their validity since their construction may rely on geometric principles that should be proven using only the straightedge and compass.
   - For example, if a drawing triangle is used to create a perpendicular line, one must question whether the angles of the triangle are accurate and how they were originally constructed.

5. **Historical Context**:
   - The text emphasizes that ancient people could construct right angles (perpendicular lines) before the invention of drawing triangles, relying solely on the straightedge and compass.
   - This historical perspective highlights the necessity of establishing fundamental constructions before using derived tools.

6. **Future Applications**: 
   - Once the basic constructions (like creating right angles) are understood, tools like drawing triangles, rulers, and protractors can be utilized to streamline the construction process.
   - Understanding the fundamental constructions allows for the creation of these tools, which can then facilitate more complex geometric tasks.
