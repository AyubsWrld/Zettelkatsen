### Strategy for Construction

1. **Analysis**: 
   - Start by sketching the required figure as accurately as possible, without physically constructing it. 
   - Use this sketch to explore how to relate the required construction to known constructions.
   - Develop a clear plan for the construction based on this analysis.

2. **Construction**:
   - Implement the construction following the plan created in the analysis step. This involves using tools like a compass and straightedge to create the figure.

3. **Synthesis (Proof)**:
   - Verify that the constructed figure meets all the requirements set by the problem. This involves providing logical reasoning or proofs to demonstrate that the construction is correct.

4. **Investigation**:
   - Investigate the solvability of the problem under the given conditions. This includes:
     - Determining whether a solution exists.
     - Analyzing how many solutions may be possible based on the given parameters.
     - Examining particular cases of interest that might arise from the conditions set in the problem.

### Example Problem: Constructing a Triangle by ASA Condition

**Given**: Two angles \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) of a triangle, and the side \( c \) included between them.

**Solution Steps**:

- **Construction and Synthesis**:
   - Draw a segment \( AB \) of length \( c \).
   - From points \( A \) and \( B \), draw rays \( m \) and \( n \) that form angles \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) with segment \( AB \), respectively. 
   - If rays \( m \) and \( n \) intersect at point \( C \), the triangle \( ABC \) satisfies the given conditions (side \( c \) between angles \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \)).

- **Investigation**:
   - Analyze the conditions under which the rays \( m \) and \( n \) intersect:
     - **Right Angles**: If both \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are right angles, the rays will not intersect, as a triangle cannot have two right angles (contradicting the exterior angle theorem).
     - **Obtuse Angles**: If either angle is obtuse, the rays will also not intersect.
     - **Sum of Angles**: If the sum of \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) is equal to or greater than two right angles, the rays will not intersect.

### Euclidean Parallel Postulate

The text introduces the notion that the rays will intersect if the sum of angles \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) is less than two right angles. This assumption is critical and is rooted in Euclidâ€™s fifth postulate, known as the **Euclidean parallel postulate**. 

- **Historical Context**:
   - The independence of the fifth postulate was debated for centuries. Many attempts to prove it from the first four postulates failed.
   - In the 19th century, mathematicians like **N. Lobachevsky** and **J. Bolyai** demonstrated that alternative geometries could be created by adopting different parallel postulates, thus showing the independence of the fifth postulate.

### Conclusion

The strategy for construction in geometry emphasizes a comprehensive approach that includes analysis, actual construction, proof of correctness, and a thorough investigation of the problem's conditions. The exploration of the Euclidean parallel postulate highlights the evolution of geometric thought and its foundational importance in understanding the nature of geometric constructions. 

This structured approach not only aids in solving geometric problems but also encourages critical thinking and deeper investigation into the principles underlying geometry.
