Our initial definition of angles assumes that the interior of an angle is convex (i.e., less than 180°). However, when combining two large angles, the result may be non-convex, necessitating the concept of **generalized angles**, which will later be useful in trigonometry.
    
- **Types of Angles:**
    1. **Acute angle:** Less than 90°.
    2. **Right angle:** Exactly 90°.
    3. **Obtuse angle:** Greater than 90° but less than 180°.
    4. **Straight angle:** Exactly 180°, formed by two rays extending each other into a straight line.
    5. **Reflex angle:** Greater than 180° but less than 360°.
    6. **Perigon (Revolution):** A full rotation of 360° or 2π radians.
- **Generalized Angles:** When a ray rotates around its origin, successive positions generate a sequence of angles. Initially, these angles are convex, but as the rotation continues, they may become non-convex (e.g., reflex angles, perigon). Generalized angles are used in trigonometry and other fields where angles greater than 360° or negative angles are relevant.
