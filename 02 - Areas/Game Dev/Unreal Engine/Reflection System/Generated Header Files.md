You'll often see a `yourfilename.generated.h` header file being included within your header files when you create them. This is an **auto-generated header file** created by the **Unreal Header Tool (UHT)** during the [[Build Process]]. 

It contains the boilerplate for: 
- **[[Networking]]**
- **[[Reflection]]**
- **[[02 - Areas/Game Dev/Unreal Engine/Serialization/Serialization]]**
- **[[Garbage Collection]]**
- **[[Blueprint Collection]]**
