If I have some positional vectors for some points which I know form a face of some geometric figure, I can use the cross product of 3 of those points to form the plane and actually produce the geometric figure. For example suppose I have the positional vectors for points $P_1$ , $P_2$ , and $P_3$ , I can take the cross product of vector $\vec{P_1 P_2}$ and $\vec{P_2 P_3}$ to produce the normal vector for the plane.
