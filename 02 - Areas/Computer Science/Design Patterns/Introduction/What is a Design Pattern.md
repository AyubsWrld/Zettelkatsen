A design pattern simply describes a design problem and the solution to that problem in such a way that is reusable .

#### What are the four parts of a Design Pattern ? 
___
Each Pattern has four essential elements: 
1) Pattern Name: describes the pattern and offers a means of explicitly referencing the pattern. 
2) The Problem: The reason for the use of the design pattern . 
3) The Solution:  The elements that make up the design. It does not specify a concrete implementation , rather a pattern that can be applied to a wide range of situations .
4) The Tradeoffs: The results and the trade-offs of applying the pattern . These are crucial for considering the consequences of implementing a design pattern and can sometimes help disqualify one pattern from another when choosing.  ( Usually concerned with space and time constraints . Also its effects on System Flexibility , extensibility , and Portability . )


#### Feynman Definition 
___
Suppose you were a construction worker , a Design Pattern is like a tool you have in your toolbox  you'd use to fulfill your day to day tasks .  Whenever face with a task you can assess what generally might be the solution to this problem . For example , your creating a door  when you notice a nail protruding outwards . You've seen this problem or a similar one and decide to reach into your toolbox to retrieve a hammer and you begin to go at the nail until its properly in place. Although you could have taken a wrench out of your toolbox to adjust the nail you decided on utilizing the hammer which was much more fit for the job , even though the wrench might have been lighter .  The hammer in this scenario is  analogous to the design pattern . The protruding nail is analogous to the problem , and the exhaustion you feel from swinging the hammer is the trade off .
