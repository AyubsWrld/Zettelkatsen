Runtime refers to the period wherein the program is running . this is after the [[Compiling]] Process  which converted the human readable instructions into machine code , all that's left is to execute on the instructions . 


Imagine you are hosting a Party , you plan who you'd like to invite and it just so happens that you are inviting individuals who might not speak the same language as you . So you have an intermediary agent who will take whatever you want to say and translate it into comprehensible instructions which the individual receiving the invitation can understand . This is the [[Compiling]]process .  Once received , the potential party attendees read whatever has been given to them and based off these instructions , they will either attend the party , or if there was an error in the following of these instructions they will not attend ( Runtime Error) . This execution of the instructions within the letters is synonymous with what occurs within [[Runtime]] .
