This is when the source code is translated into executable code (machine code, bytecode, etc.) by a compiler. Compile-time errors, such as syntax errors, are caught during this phase.

Imagine you are hosting a Party , you plan who you'd like to invite and it just so happens that you are inviting individuals who might not speak the same language as you . So you have an intermediary agent who will take whatever you want to say and translate it into comprehensible instructions which the individual receiving the invitation can understand . This is the compiling process .
