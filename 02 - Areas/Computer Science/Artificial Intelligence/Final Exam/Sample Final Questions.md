1) What is a heuristic function in the context of AI? 
	1) A function that provides an estimate of how close a state is to the goal
2) Which search algorithm guarantees the finding of the optimal solution?
	1) Breadth First Search : This is optimal
	2) Depth-first search
	3) A* search
	4) <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Greedy best-first search</mark> : Can't be this because it just looks for the best search result at the current node does not mean it's optimal.
