**Backtracking** is a problem-solving algorithmic technique used to find solutions by exploring possible options step by step, and when a potential solution path leads to a dead end or an invalid state, it **reverses** (backtracks) to the previous step and tries a different option. Itâ€™s commonly used in solving **combinatorial problems** like puzzles, constraint satisfaction, and pathfinding.
