<center> Lets suppose you are in champ select in a game of League of Legends . You are last pick and you notice that the enemy team have drafted Lulu , Twitch , Xin Zhao , Gnar , and Syndra. Your knowledge base may include that they have drafted those Five Champions . An example of a model in this scenario would be a set of statements which assign each character to their respective lane. </center> 

$$M_1 = \text{Syndra is mid , Twitch is Jungle , Lulu is Support , Xin Zhao is Bot , Gnar is Top}$$
$$M_2 = \text{Syndra is Top, Twitch is Jungle , Lulu is Support , Xin Zhao is Bot , Gnar is Mid}$$

<center> Or any other configuration of these are plausible models </center>

<center> Although this may very well be the case there might exist a model wherein Twitch is jungle and we have a Xin Zhao bot . </center> 

<center> We load into the game and our first model happens to be true. However we want to keep an eye out for Xin Zhao as he might show up and gank us top. Based off of our knowledge base , Xin Zhao started red buff and is now is a position to gank us ( We are playing immobile champ top ). We can infer based off of what we know to be true in our knowledge base that , if Xin Zhao has cleared botside , we are playing an immobile champion , and there is a timer for him to come top and gank us and he is on vision , then that means he WILL gank us</center>
