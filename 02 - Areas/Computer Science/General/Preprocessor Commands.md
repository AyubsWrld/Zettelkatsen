Preprocessor commands, also known as preprocessor directives, are instructions given to the compiler to perform specific actions before the actual compilation of the code begins. They usually start with a `#` symbol and are used to include files, define constants, and control conditional compilation.

### Common Preprocessor Directives:
- `#include`: Includes the contents of a file or library.
- `#define`: Defines macros or constants.
- `#ifdef` / `#ifndef`: Conditional compilation based on whether a macro is defined.
- `#endif`: Ends a conditional compilation block.

### Analogy:
Think of preprocessor commands as a set of instructions given to a chef before they start cooking. These instructions tell the chef what ingredients to prepare, which recipes to use, and any special steps to follow before actually cooking the meal (compiling the code).
