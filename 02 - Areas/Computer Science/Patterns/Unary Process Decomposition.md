To improve performance, CPU designers have long abandoned the simple model of fetching, decoding, and executing one instruction at a time. Many modern CPUs have facilities for executing more than one instruction at the same time. For example, a CPU might have separate fetch, decode, and execute units, so that while it is executing instruction n, it could also be decoding instruction n + 1 and fetch ing instruction n + 2. Such an organization is called a pipeline and is illustrated in Fig. 1-7(a) for a pipeline with three stages. Longer pipelines are common. In most pipeline designs, once an instruction has been fetched into the pipeline, it must be executed, even if the preceding instruction was a conditional branch that was taken. 22 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 Pipelines cause compiler writers and operating system writers great headaches be cause they expose the complexities of the underlying machine to them and they have to deal with them.
