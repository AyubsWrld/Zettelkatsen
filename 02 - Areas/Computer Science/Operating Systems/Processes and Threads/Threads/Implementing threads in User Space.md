- **User Space**: elegant, works across platforms, and gives the program definer complete and granular control over thread scheduling. Most of it's allure is associated with the fact that there is no alterations made to the Kernel and thus is a portable means of implementation of thread scheduling. We really don't have to make any changes to how system calls fundamentally work ( which are OS implementation specific ). 
	- Another alternative is available in the event that it is possible to tell in advance if a call will block. In most versions of UNIX, a system call, select, exists, which allows the caller to tell whether a prospective read will block. When this call is present, the library procedure read can be replaced with a new one that first does a select call and then does the read call only if it is safe (i.e., will not block). If the read call will block, the call is not made. Instead, another thread is run. The next time the run-time system gets control, it can check again to see if the read is now safe. This approach requires rewriting parts of the system call library, and is inefficient and inelegant, but there is little choice. The code placed around the system call to do the checking is called a jacket or wrapper
