#### Goal: Maximize **CPU utilization** by keeping it busy.
- Multiple programs are kept in memory at once.
- The **CPU switches** to another process **only when the current one blocks** (e.g., waiting for I/O).
- **No interactive user experience** â€” used primarily in batch systems.
- Context switching is **infrequent**, based on long CPU bursts and I/O waits.
