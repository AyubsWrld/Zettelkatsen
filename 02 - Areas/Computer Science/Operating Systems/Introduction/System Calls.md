#### System Calls Brief 

- **Procedure Calls**: A procedure call is a normal control flow operation that typically executes within the same privilege level (user or kernel mode), and does _not_ require switching from user mode to kernel mode. ( Function call ) 
- **System Calls**: A procedure call is a control flow operation that requires the CPU to enter Kernel Mode to execute. **System Calls** allow [[User Mode]] programs to hand over control of execution to the Kernel so that it may fulfil some operation.
