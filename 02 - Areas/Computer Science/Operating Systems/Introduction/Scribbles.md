- User mode vs. Kernel mode. 
- Both are different suites of software.
- Kernel Mode gives access to hardware features. 
- Kernel is immutable. 
- If a user doesn't like an emailing software ( User mode application ), they can simply just remove it themselves or write a completely new one if they so choose. If a user does not like their scheduler they cannot just write a new scheduler.
