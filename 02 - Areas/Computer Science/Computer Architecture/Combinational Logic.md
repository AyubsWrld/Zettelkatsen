**Combinational Circuit delay** 
Comes in two forms 
- **Contamination Delay** ($t_{cd}$) minimum delay 
- **Propagation Delay** ($t_{pd}$) maximum delay  
these are measured between the time between when the circuits output reflects the changes of the inputs  . Usually in the order of nano-seconds . Output gauranteed to change between input and output .
