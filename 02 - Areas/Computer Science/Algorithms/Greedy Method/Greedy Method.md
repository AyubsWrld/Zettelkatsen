The **Greedy** Approach in programming is when you approach a question without retaining any notion of state beyond what is currently beneficial . Usually , actions cannot be undone and if the action has been taken it must be moved on with . You only consider yourself with what is best at the moment . not what is best in the long run . 

> [!example] **Feynman Definition**
 > Imagine you are playing league of legends . Your playing against an AP champion . And while laning enemy botlane  gets a double kill and tower first blood . Knowing this you decide to build items which will help you in your fight later on against the botlane even though it might not be optimal vs the AP champion your laning against at the time , it is what works best right now . And as the game goes on your shift your build when necessary based on the games condition or what is most ideal . These decisions are irreversible and cannot be changed later in the game .
